You can add names to the box also.\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won\u2019t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won\u2019t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to keep your drinks warm and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.","policy_refunds":"We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.","policy_additional":"FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015.\r\n\r\n**Super Fall Sale!**\r\n\r\nFALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75\r\nFALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185\r\nFALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499","policy_seller_info":"The Ultimate Man Shop is owned and operated by Richard Hudson and Joe T from Sparrowbush NY.  \r\nPlease contact us at ultimatemanshop@gmail.com","policy_updated_tsz":1443703193,"vacation_autoreply":"Hi there, \r\n\r\nThank you for your message.

As the demand rose, the companies would venture into new concepts and designs with even more outrageous finishes that can be seen here. \n\nThese Highly Collectable pieces are great additions to your vintage bar or ever growing personal collection. Check out this Vintage Original Jim Beam Liquor Decanters Featuring Complimentary Queen Mary Beam Bottle Club &quot;The Surfer&quot; Brown Bear Designs With Matching Top Hat&#39;s.\n\nThe majority of bottles we have available range in size from 8&quot;-12&quot; depending on the bottle you select.
