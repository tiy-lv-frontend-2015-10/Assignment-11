Please specify any changes in the Notes to Seller at checkout**\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.  Whiskey stones are Dishwasher Safe.\n\n**I&#39;M ALL ABOUT CUSTOM ORDERS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLES PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DISCOUNT PRICE, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITHIN YOUR BUDGET**\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",

Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",

Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

"description": "Whiskey Stones are a Unique and Popular gift on their own, but when they are personalized they become extra special.\n\nThis listing is for a set of 4 Large Engraved Whiskey Stones.  They make a great gift for a current or veteran Military hero!  \n\nChristmas, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always a well received gift.\n\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1.15&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA. Only 1 or 2  are needed per drink.  Each set comes in it&#39;s own Muslin Storage bag with an instructions for use card.\n\nThe pictured stones are currently engraved with the US Marines Eagle, Globe and Anchor, USMC and the recipients Initials however each order can be customized and I can engrave anything on the Stones, just send me your engraving instructions in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at check out or send me an Etsy Convo.

Please specify any changes in the Notes to Seller at checkout**\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.  Whiskey stones are Dishwasher Safe.\n\n**I&#39;M ALL ABOUT CUSTOM ORDERS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLES PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DISCOUNT PRICE, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITHIN YOUR BUDGET**\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?  Check out my shop via the link below for more great gifts for Men.

On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",

Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",

Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",

Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",

Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",

Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

In the thousands of glasses we have shipped, only one has ever broken....something we take great pride in. \r\n\r\nIn the rare event a glass is broken in transit, we unfortunately cannot accept responsibility. You will need to contact USPS directly to file a damaged claim with them, as this is most assuredly due to rough handling in transit, not a packaging issue on our end. They will probably require photos of the damaged item in the packaging, so make sure to save it!\r\n\r\nCUSTOM AND DUTY FEES:\r\n          - These will be the responsibility of the buyer.

We will declare proper item value and descriptions when shipping, but are not responsible for items confiscated by customs officials due to import violations. \r\n          \r\n          - If you are uncertain of your country&#39;s import restrictions, please use this link: http://pe.usps.com/text/imm/ab_toc.htm\r\n\r\n...............................................................................\r\n...............................................................................\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCOMMON BUT NOT UNHEARD OF PROBLEMS WITH MAIL DELIVERY:\r\n\r\n          - UNABLE TO DELIVER - If a package is returned to us after unsuccessful delivery attempt by USPS due to an incorrect or incomplete address provided on the Etsy account/order, the customer will be responsible for the cost of reshipping.

We order our glasses through American manufacturers and hand engrave each one to order. We check each glass prior to engraving for any noticeable flaws. As each piece of glass is completely unique, please allow for small imperfections on the surface of the glass. We like to think it adds character!\r\n\r\nENGRAVING SPECS ~ We will attempt to honor all custom engraving requests, however there are some instances where a layout may not work as requested.

"title": "Set of 4 Engraved Large US Army Whiskey Rocks with Muslin Bag, Perfect Stocking Stuffer, Great US Military Christmas Gift, Made in the USA",
"description": "Whiskey Stones are a Unique and Popular gift on their own, but when they are personalized they become extra special.\n\nThis listing is for a set of 4 Large Engraved Whiskey Stones.  They make a great gift for a current or veteran Military hero!  \n\nChristmas, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always a well received gift.\n\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1.15&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA. Only 1 or 2  are needed per drink.  Each set comes in it&#39;s own Muslin Storage bag with an instructions for use card.\n\nThe pictured stones are currently engraved with the US Army Emblem, US Army and the recipients Initials however each order can be customized and I can engrave anything on the Stones, just send me your engraving instructions in the &quot;Notes to Seller&quot; section at check out or send me an Etsy Convo.

Please specify any changes in the Notes to Seller at checkout**\n\n**What are Whiskey Stones?**\n\nWhiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.  Whiskey stones are Dishwasher Safe.\n\n**I&#39;M ALL ABOUT CUSTOM ORDERS SO IF YOU NEED MULTIPLES PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A DISCOUNT PRICE, I WILL DO MY BEST TO WORK WITHIN YOUR BUDGET**\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",

Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",

Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

Just use this code when you check out :-)  &#39;BOOTIES10&#39;\r\n\r\nHi my name is Sarah & I have been a Holistic Therapist for over 10 years and have always made my own blends to use on my clients, a few years ago i was asked to also supply my products to retail, so i came up with my product range MEDUSA HOLISTICS to go alongside my hobby of DESIGNING JEWELLERY which i have been doing for over 9 years now and love coming up with crazy and unusual designs, love using items and finds that others would normally shy away from, my aim is to create wow factors & talk of the party pieces.\r\nI try to keep my work unique & unusual to give my customers statement pieces & conversational starters. My Inspiration is based on several themes RUSTIC/UPCYCLING/RECYCLING/BRASS and SPLATTER PUNK HORROR.....\r\n\r\nWEDDING/PARTY/EVENTS\r\nIn my shop you will now find handcrafted Lipbalms, Scratch cards & favour boxes that are ideal for wedding/party favours.......Order them in bulk to receive a discount....You can also choose to have them personalised at no extra cost too.\r\n\r\nBOOTIES & SLIPPERS-\r\nSince having my beautiful daughter, i acquired a love for cute baby clothes & wanted to create her things made by hand- so you will now find baby booties made from cotton fabrics & beautiful woven baby wrap scraps.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you love my work as much as i enjoy designing and creating it :-)\r\n\r\nRUSTIC & BRASS\r\nBeen a Yorkshire (Huddersfield) girl myself, I try to use locally sourced recycled, antique, finds from as near to Yorkshire as I possibly can, but when I fall in love with something I just have to have it, so some items may have flown from the other side of the world to be made into a piece of Medusa&#39;s wearable artwork.\r\nYou will notice a lot of the items I have listed are made from raw & antique brass, this has been sourced from turkey. I love my brass supplier, there is so much choice to inspire my crazy & rustic designs and it&#39;s the best quality I have found after searching for so many years! \r\nI am proud to say that I am not scared of using something different that others may shy away from.\r\n\r\nSPLATTER PUNK HORROR\r\nThe other side of Medusa Bijoux is my love of Splatter Punk & Horror. You may find some disturbing pieces within this range, with realistic blood splattered beads & murder themed names.....it&#39;s not real blood....Honest :-) \r\n  \r\nI love a challenge so if there is something you have in mind but cannot find within my shop please message me to discuss custom pieces & alterations.\r\n\r\nI also offer an alteration & repairs service (FREE for Medusa Bijoux items, no matter how long you have had them) you only pay for postage.\r\n\r\nMost items can be made to measure, if you require this service please message me before you pay to ensure it&#39;s possible to do so.\r\nIf you realise after your purchase is received that size needs to be adjusted please contact me to organise a free alteration, you will only be required to pay postage for this service.\r\n\r\nBased In Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England",

If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.",

If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage.  We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product.  If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable.  This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable.  We do not want any of our products in use if thy are not up to our standards for quality.  We will instruct you how marr and photograph the item.\r\n\r\nPlease also see the above section for refund info.",

We want you to enjoy your shirt, wear it out, and tell everyone where you got it. We&#39;re happy to make sure you&#39;re going to love wearing your new t-shirt. All exchanges/refunds must be sent back within 15 days of receipt.\r\n\r\nSince our t-shirts are made to order we can not always accept returns on custom shirts, or low popular items. We only allow for exchanges. If there is a quality issue please contact us, and if we are in error we will certainly refund you.",
