The Cigar pen has a sophisticated, heavy presence for those who enjoy a larger and heavier writing instrument.\n\nOverall finished length is approximately 5-5\/8&quot;. This pen utilizes a Parker style refill and uses a premium double twist mechanism for flawless smooth action and is made from a used Jack Daniel&#39;s whiskey barrel..\n\nMy Jack Daniels items are made from white oak barrel staves from authentic Jack Daniels charred oak whiskey barrels used for aging whiskey. The whiskey is aged in these barrels and then the barrels are salvaged and disassembled for the staves.\n\nA Certificate of Authenticity is included with each Jack Daniels item purchased. \n\nAlso included is a nice black velvet gift pouch.\n\nJACK DANIEL\u2019S is a registered trademark and is not involved in or affiliated with the production or distribution of this product.\n\n\nPlease check out all my Jack Daniels products at:\nhttps:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/PensPrintsAndThings?section_id=15976969&ref=shopsection_leftnav_1","creation_tsz":1445891116,"ending_tsz":1456521916,"original_creation_tsz":1416104205,"last_modified_tsz":1445891431,"price":"21.50","currency_code":"USD","quantity":5,"tags":["jack daniels","jack","daniels","whiskey","barrel","bourbon","oak","pen","cigar","Jack Daniel's","whiskey barrel","whiskey barrel pen","Gunmetal"],"category_path":["Housewares","Office"],"category_path_ids":[69150425,68892024],"materials":["Jack Daniels Oak","Gunmetal Finish"],"shop_section_id":15976969,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1445891116,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/211326417\/whiskey-barrel-cigar-style-twist-pen?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":172,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":3469192164,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1102,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Office","Office & School Supplies"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":840965746,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443394148,"listing_id":211326417,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_75x75.840965746_sy51.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_170x135.840965746_sy51.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_570xN.840965746_sy51.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_fullxfull.840965746_sy51.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":840740641,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443394148,"listing_id":211326417,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8942013\/il_75x75.840740641_mq3s.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8942013\/il_170x135.840740641_mq3s.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8942013\/il_570xN.840740641_mq3s.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/101\/0\/8942013\/il_fullxfull.840740641_mq3s.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":840740643,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443394148,"listing_id":211326417,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8942013\/il_75x75.840740643_bqta.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8942013\/il_170x135.840740643_bqta.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8942013\/il_570xN.840740643_bqta.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/8942013\/il_fullxfull.840740643_bqta.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":840965626,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1443394148,"listing_id":211326417,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_75x75.840965626_4zbz.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_170x135.840965626_4zbz.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_570xN.840965626_4zbz.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/103\/0\/8942013\/il_fullxfull.840965626_4zbz.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":8942013,"shop_name":"PensPrintsAndThings","user_id":42045356,"creation_tsz":1388265686,"title":"Custom Handcrafted Pens and Beautiful Giclee Prints ","announcement":null,"currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":null,"sale_message":"Thank you so much for your purchase.

If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.

Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.","policy_refunds":"Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel.

In order to earn it&#39;s title, Bourbon, the spirit must be aged in new charred oak barrels, while Scotch and Irish Whiskey barrels are often used multiple times.
