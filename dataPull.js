"title": "4 Sets - Unique Groomsmen Gifts, 4 Engraved Whiskey Stones in a Personalized Box, The Perfect present for the Best Man or Grooms Party",

This makes a great gift for Weddings, Christmas, Stocking Fillers, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always are well received gift.\n\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1.15&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA.

Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015.\r\n\r\n**Super Fall Sale!**\r\n\r\nFALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75\r\nFALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185\r\nFALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

If you are in a time crunch, please note this on your order at checkout and we&#39;ll do our best to get your fabulous labels to you on time.\r\n\r\nWishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a safe holiday season!\r\n\r\nHappy Everything!\r\n\r\nRachel",

"digital_sale_message": "Thank you for your order!  These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel",

"policy_shipping": "Standard orders in the US ship in 2 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 5-7 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade-  Typically 4-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door)\r\nPRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!",
"policy_refunds": "Due to the custom nature of the product, we cannot offer refunds, returns or exchanges once the design process has begun. However, I believe in happy customers so please discuss any issues you have with your order and I will do everything possible to ensure I&#39;ve exceeded your expectations!",
"policy_additional": "It is important to include all requested info needed to complete your order.  Missing information will likely delay your order shipment.  Design changes or capitalization requests must be stated separately at check out.  Abbreviations are made where necessary. \r\n\r\nProofs are available at no charge based on request!  Please note a &quot;PROOF REQUEST&quot; on your order at check out if interested!  Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;",

"policy_shipping": "We keep our items in stock for immediate shipment. We usually ship within 1 to 2 days of receipt of payment. If there is a reason why your shipment will be delayed we will let you know via convo.\r\n\r\nAll orders are sent via USPS first class mail in inside a padded envelope or USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail boxes. We ship to the address listed in your Etsy order.\r\n\r\nDelivery confirmation through the Post Office is included on all orders. When your order is shipped, we will send an email to the address as provided with your PayPal account or as provided via Etsy Direct Checkout.\r\n\r\n♥ International Shipping:\r\nWe ship first class air mail, and the International Shipping cost is an average of places to which we ship. If the actual cost is more, we&#39;ll contact you with the amount and get your &quot;okay&quot; before we ship.\r\n\r\nWe are not responsible for any duty or customs fees that may be charged to you. We cannot be responsible for lost international shipments, unless you specifically paid to have the shipment insured. We can quote shipping insurance upon request.\r\n\r\nA Note About Wire\r\nWire is heavy. The more you buy the heavier it is. Still, it is much more economical for you to buy as much wire as you can at one time. This cuts down on your overall shipping cost, which cuts the cost you pay for your wire. \r\n\r\nOnce you get above 12 or 13 ounces, it is better to use the Priority Mail small box or the new larger Regional Rate boxes. They have flat rates and have no weight limit if shipped within the USA.\r\n\r\n",

If you are unhappy for any reason, contact us and we will make it right.\r\n\r\nWe reserve the right to charge a restocking fee of 15% on all returned items.

We love our customers and treat each on as if they were our only customer.",

This makes a great gift for Weddings, Christmas, Stocking Fillers, Birthdays, Anniversaries, Military Weddings, Whiskey Stones are always are well received gift.\n\nEach Whiskey Stone measures 1.15&quot; x 1&quot; and is made of 100% Soapstone right here in the USA.

Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015.\r\n\r\n**Super Fall Sale!**\r\n\r\nFALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75\r\nFALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185\r\nFALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

SOMETIMES MONITOR SETTINGS CHANGE THE COLOR OF THE ITEM FROM WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND SOMETIMES AN ITEM DOESN&#39;T PHOTOGRAPH TO ITS TRUE COLOR.\r\n\r\nWelcome to my Etsy store. I have over 900 handmade product listings to cater to every style and taste and I am adding more nearly every week. My jewelry makes wonderful gifts- especially for that person that seems to have everything or just as a treat for yourself. All small jewelry items come wrapped in a gift box with a bow or in a small box and pouch ready to give. If you don&#39;t see an idea or product you like, feel free to convo me or purchase my custom order listing and I will do my best to create a listing just for you. I love to be challenged with custom orders. I am also willing to tweak existing orders upon request(ie turning a necklace into a pin, keychain, or a hanging Christmas ornament) and I love to hear what people think. I can also make multiples of products available upon request with discounts available for large orders upon request. Most items have free additional item shipping rates. If you would like to buy 2 day priority shipping convo me before you order for an upgraded listing cost. Be sure to favorite my shop on Facebook for listing updates, promotions, and giveaways.

"policy_shipping": "I use USPS to ship items and it could take as long as 6 weeks if shipping is going overseas. I will package items as carefully as possible to avoid breakage and will ship the next available business day(M-F). I will also include a tracking number and delivery confirmation through USPS. If your item does not update as fast as expected it is not my responsibility. Sometimes the post office takes as long as a week to update your tracking info and I can&#39;t do anything about that. Also, if you live in the US, it may take as long as 14 business days to receive your product if the Postal Service has any issues or delays. It&#39;s unfortunate but it does occasionally happen. If you need expedited shipping to the US, please convo me for a rate for 2 day priority mail. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR ITEM DUE TO AN INCORRECT ADDRESS AND IT IS RETURNED TO ME, YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR THE NEW SHIPPING TO SEND IT TO THE CORRECT ADDRESS. IF IT DOES NOT GET RETURNED TO ME AND IT WAS DELIVERED TO THE WRONG ADDRESS DUE TO A MISTAKE ON THE BUYER&#39;S PART I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE TO REFUND YOUR MONEY OR SEND YOU A NEW ITEM. Please be sure to verify that you have the correct info before placing your order to ensure prompt delivery and an easy transaction.\r\n\r\nI am not responsible for import taxes and fees imposed by the buyer&#39;s country of residence. If you are charged an additional amount upon receiving your item, it is being imposed by your country/government. I always ensure that all shipping fees are paid when your packages ship out. I also have no way of knowing how much you will be charged for receiving an &quot;import&quot; and cannot give a quote. \r\n\r\nONCE AN ITEM HAS BEEN SCANNED AS DELIVERED, IT IS NO LONGER MY RESPONSIBILITY IF IT SHOULD GO MISSING. INSURANCE IS AVAILABLE IF REQUESTED AT THE TIME OF ORDERING. IF IT IS NOT REQUESTED AND PURCHASED BEFORE YOUR ORDER SHIPS, I AM NOT LIABLE TO ISSUE A REFUND OR SEND A REPLACEMENT. (SEE REFUND POLICY)",
"policy_refunds": "If your item arrives damaged or broken let me know and I will make it right. I will also replace missing items at my discretion once an appropriate amount of time has passed and every effort has been made to recover it. Keep in mind that if I issue a refund to you for a broken item it will be minus the cost of shipping. I am NOT responsible for the postal service making delay causing errors or items getting stuck in customs. I am also not responsible for making sure a last minute order reaches the recipient by the specified date. I WILL NOT GIVE OUT REFUNDS IF AN ITEM GOES MISSING AFTER BEING SCANNED AS DELIVERED. I VIEW THAT AS AN ISSUE ON THE BUYER&#39;S END AND AM NO LONGER RESPONSIBLE. I will not accept returns if the item is not what you expected. I truly and accurately represent the item that you will receive(unless otherwise stated that it might vary slightly due to high demand) and I am not responsible for color variations due to monitor resolution or size misconception on the part of the buyer. I measure all of my items when I list them and put an accurate size in inches so please read the listings carefully. I also describe my products in detail so if you fail to read the description and the item is different from what you expected I am not responsible. Sometimes photos can be misleading if I take a closeup picture of a very small item to show its details. I will however make it right if I inadvertently send you the wrong item if I should happen to get my envelopes mixed up when I am shipping multiple orders on the same day. I try and be as careful as I can but I am human and accidents happen. Please allow me the chance to make it right before leaving a negative feedback. I do value all of my customers and love the chance to make everyone happy.\r\n\r\nI must be contacted within 3 days of the item&#39;s receipt if it is broken or the wrong item. If you have not contacted me within this time frame I will assume that your order is fine and will not be responsible for refunding your money or sending you a new item. Also, once an item has been scanned as delivered, I am not responsible for replacing it should it go missing after that fact.\r\n\r\nAny clearance/discounted items are old stock and may have small defects or imperfections. They ship as is and all sales are final.",
"policy_additional": "I am always open to special orders and ideas so feel free to contact me. I am also willing to alter existing items to fit your needs(ie chain length, metal free cording, etc...). My jewelry makes wonderful bridemaids gifts. All I ask is that you give me enough time to make and ship the items before you need them. All items come wrapped for giving- either in a small box and bag, or in a small gift box with a bow. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would ask that if you request a custom order that you buy it once it is made and posted. I do spend my own time and money creating your pieces and it&#39;s only reasonable that you purchase them upon completion. If a custom order is over $25.00 I will expect a 100% payment before I start creating it to ensure purchase of the final product. If a custom order is not purchased within 7 days of listing(unless otherwise agreed upon), it will go into the regular section of my shop for anyone to purchase.",

"policy_additional": "SIZING\r\n=====\r\nPlease note that most of our rings are made with a COMFORT FIT unless you request otherwise. We are unable to re-size majority of our rings, so it is vital that we get the sizing correct the first time. We recommend getting sized until at least two reputable jewelers agree on the same size, I highly recommend asking the jeweler to use a caliper or micrometer, because it is more accurate than a ring wand. You can even provide me with the inside diameter in mm. Our sizing is the same as the ISO standard, you can look here for information: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_size\r\n \r\nHOW TO DETERMINE YOUR RING SIZE:\r\nEtsy does not provide an area where I can post a write-up, with pictures, so I decided to provide you with a link to my blog that have pictures and instructions:\r\nhttp://jewelrybyjohan.com/how-to-get-your-ring-sized-properly/\r\nhttp://jewelrybyjohan.com/how-to-measure-a-ring/\r\n\r\nI can send you a free set of plastic sizers after you have placed the order. Please write in the messages area at checkout &quot;send free sizers&quot;, but these sizers are only 3.5 mm wide and might not be the most accurate way to get sized.

Any other business selling Ring Armor is selling you an imitation.\r\nRing Armor is included on all of our wood and/or antler style rings. If you prefer not to have Ring Armor, please leave a note during checkout. However, it is highly recommended.\r\n\r\nMETAL SPECIFIC INFORMATION\r\n=================================\r\n1) TITANIUM\r\n\r\nTitanium, like all jewelry metals, will acquire surface scratches or scuffs through everyday wear. Scratches will be particularly evident in new ring, but as the ring is worn it develop a natural, even satin patina over the entire surface.\r\n\r\nProtect your ring by removing it during activities that may subject it to abrasion or hard knocks. We recommend that you not wear any type of ring at the gym, when gardening, playing sports, or at the beach.\r\n\r\n Titanium is a very lightweight but durable metal that does have the ability to scratch, which can be buffed out; it can dent but it should not crack, we use 6AL4 Grade 5 Titanium. It is the most commonly used alloy. It has a chemical composition of 6% aluminum, 4% vanadium, 0.25% (maximum) iron, 0.2% (maximum) oxygen, and the remainder titanium. It is significantly stronger than commercially pure titanium while having the same stiffness and thermal properties. Among its many advantages, it is heat treatable. This grade is an excellent combination of strength, corrosion resistance, weld and fabric ability, this is the same Grade of titanium that is used in Biomedical Implants. Most hospitals have the tools necessary to remove a titanium band in an emergency situation therefore there is no need to worry about the removal of a finger in an emergency.\r\n\r\nFinishes available in Titanium: \r\nPolished\r\nMatte\r\nBrushed\r\nFrosted\r\nDeep Frost\r\nSandblasted\r\nhttps://img0.etsystatic.com/015/0/5326225/il_fullxfull.427869884_rd4e.jpg?ref=l2\r\n \r\n2) TUNGSTEN \r\n Tungsten is the 2nd hardest metal and is extremely scratch resistant. However it does have the ability to shatter if it is hit too hard against something or dropped on a hard surface.\r\n\r\nThe tungsten is composed of tungsten, carbon and nickel. The binder that bonds the tungsten and carbon is nickel. \r\n\r\n3)CERAMIC\r\nThe ceramic is Hi-Tech Ceramic or Jewelry Grade Ceramic. It is ceramic mixed with carbon to form a lightweight carbide similar to tungsten carbide. However, it is correct in saying that it has no metal. We use it in place of tungsten because it is almost as hard as tungsten carbide making it extremely scratch resistant, but it can be made to be black. Similar to tungsten carbide, ceramic could chip if dropped on a hard surface. It is rare, but it can happen.\r\n\r\n4) SILVER:\r\nType: Lustrous precious metal, valued for its beauty.\r\nSterling: .925 sterling silver. \r\nDurability: Pure silver is relatively soft, very malleable, and easily damaged so it is commonly combined with other metals to produce a more durable product. The silver we use consists of 92.5% silver and 7.5% of alloy.\r\nColor: White.\r\nFinish: Polish, bright and sparkling.\r\n\r\n5) YELLOW GOLD/ WHITE GOLD:\r\nType: 10 K, 14K or 18K\r\nConsists of: silver, copper, zinc, nicel, palladium and are used to make gold more durable for everyday wear. If you are allergic to nicel ally you may have an allergic reaction to yellow gold.  The white gold we use is X1 white gold nickel alloy, it does not require rhodium plating.\r\n\r\n6) PLATINUM\r\nConsists of: ruthenium, iridium, platinum. Platinum is hypoallergenic, and will retain white color. However it is susceptible to scratches, just like any other metal.\r\n\r\n7) PALLADIUM\r\nConsists of: ruthenium, iridium. Palladium is hypoallergenic, and will maintains natural white color, great luster enhances gems, naturally strong metal, lighter than platinum. However it is susceptible to scratches, just like any other metal.\r\n\r\n=================================\r\nMATERIAL SPECIFIC INFORMATION:\r\n=================================\r\n\r\n1) ANTLER\r\n=================================\r\nANTLER COLOR: \r\nThe color of your custom ring containing antler will differ from the listed picture it may vary in color, lightness and/ or darkness.\r\n\r\nDifferent coloration in antlers depends partly on the amount of oxidized blood on the antlers (from velvet shedding) and partly from a chemical reaction between the blood and juices from plants on which the antlers are rubbed. If a buck begins rubbing his antlers before the velvet and blood have completely dried, the blood stains the antler and gives it a darker color. The predominant species of trees in an area also influence the color. Pines allegedly cause darker antlers, likely from bucks rubbing on exposed sap after they break the tree&#39;s cambium layer. A buck&#39;s genetics may also influence color. Some bucks are predisposed to having lighter or darker antlers, and to rub more or fewer trees. A buck&#39;s age can play a role as older bucks tend to rub more than younger animals. Finally, the time of year can also influence color as antlers generally lighten over time due to the bleaching effect of moisture, sunlight and extreme winter conditions. Because the ring inlay it is made from a natural product, the color of your ring will vary from the one pictured however  we will do our best to match the listed image. \r\n\r\nSENDING YOUR OWN ANTLER: \r\nPlease contact us for the minimum size that we would need.\r\n \r\n2) WOOD\r\n=================================\r\nWOOD COLOR:  \r\nRemember that the beauty of wood is its natural variation. Even two pieces of the same species of wood can vary in its natural color/lightness/darkness, effecting the final perception. Each piece of wood from the same species have the same patterns in them typically, unfortunately we can&#39;t really control the exact color of wood as it is an organic material, however  we will do our best to match the listed image. \r\n\r\nCHANGING WOOD CHOICE:\r\nIf you would like to select a different wood, than on the listing that you are purchasing. Please use the following link to view the available wood choices:\r\n \r\nhttps://jewelrybyjohan.com/portfolio-view/wood-rings-collection/\r\nClick on the :Wood Species Example List\r\nPlease narrow down your wood choices to 3 favorites and let us know what they are, during checkout. We need this information no later than three days after your purchased date.\r\n \r\nOnce we have received your choices we will send you photos of that species of wood that we currently have in stock for you to choose from, please note that this could be up to a couple of weeks before starting your ring.\r\n\r\nWOOD DURABILITY\r\nIf the wood doesn&#39;t have ring armor applied the wood isn&#39;t that durable, and it will have the potential of swelling, drying out then possibly cracking. For a raw piece of wood, one would need to look at the Janka Hardness test for the specific wood type http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janka_hardness_test\r\n \r\nThe Ring Armor Service is very durable and will protect the wood from water, UV rays, nicks and scratches. Please read more about it here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/124782718/ring-armor-ring-waterproofing-service?ref=shop_home_active&ga_search_query=waterproof\r\n\r\nUNTREATED WOOD AND MOISTURE:\r\nThe nature of untreated wood is such that it will break down with enough exposure to water. It is recommend you avoid getting your untreated wood rings wet. Moisture may cause the wood to expand and contract, and eventually cause your wood to crack.\r\n\r\nWood Maintenance for a ring without RING ARMOR:\r\nIf your ring is not coated with our Ring Armor, we recommend not getting it wet. You can treat the wood with linseed oil as often as you feel necessary, to help prevent the wood from drying out and possibly cracking and it will also help repel water which will cause the wood to swell.\r\n\r\nSENDING OWN WOOD:\r\nThe wood needs to be dry, at least 1.5” in diameter and 3” long. Please include a note with your Etsy user id and order # in the package and ship to the following address:\r\n \r\nDistinctly Johan\r\nC/O (YOUR NAME HERE)\r\n592 Hayward Avenue North\r\nOakdale, MN 55128\r\n \r\nI can use your wood as long as it meets the following criteria:\r\n1. It has a minimum diameter of 1.5&quot; with minimum length of 3&quot;\r\n2. It is dry\r\n3. Free of checks and cracks.\r\n\r\nThese Woods are Exotic and if you choose any of the following, please note that they are an extra charge:\r\nIronwood (Burl)\r\nRosewood(Honduran Burl)\r\nCollibah\r\nSindora\r\n\r\n3) DINOSAUR\r\n=================================\r\nDinosaur Bone is actually called a Gembone and has been described as the most rare and most beautiful fossils in the world &quot;Simply defined, a gembone is the fossil of an animal bone that contains gem quality minerals. Gembone is also commonly referred to as mineralized dinosaur bone, silicified dinosaur bone and agatized fossil&quot;. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately we do not know what species of dinosaur the dinosaur bone comes from. The dinosaur bone used in all our rings come from the Morrison Formation in Utah which spans 600,000 square miles making it the largest and most fertile source of dinosaur fossil in North America.\r\n\r\nDINOSAUR BONE (GEMBONE) COLORS:\r\nWe will send you our available colors for you to pick from the month before your ring is due to be shipped. If you have a preferred color, please mention it during checkout and we will do our best to find a gembone that has that color.\r\n\r\nDinosaur bone is very rare; it is an agatized stone, the color is determined by the combination of minerals present when the fossilized bone formed; that’s what makes each piece so unique and beautiful. That is why our stock is always changing, as we use what we have and then have to buy more when we start to run out, however we are not always sure what the color will be of the new piece till we cut into the gembone. Once we run out of a color that we currently have or had, the changes of us getting the same color is unlikely. \r\n\r\nDINOSAUR BONE (GEMBONE) CARE:\r\nAcids: Avoid\r\nSolvents: Resistant\r\nSoap: OK\r\nAvoid contact with other gems and polishing agents.\r\nDO NOT SOAK IN ALCOHOL\r\n \r\nTake care not to hit it against a hard surface, it could chip or break like any other stone. Also we do recommend to take the ring off when you wash your hands, shower, swim etc., especially if the ring also has meteorite or wood inlays without ring armor.\r\n\r\n4) METEORITE\r\n=================================\r\nMeteorite is an iron based material and does have the potential to rust. However it should not chip, crack or break. It does however have the potential to scratch or dent like any other material. If you would like your ring to stay nice looking, don’t abuse your jewelry, treat it like you would any other fine jewelry, don’t wear while doing intense activities that would be hard on your hands (yard work, construction, automotive repair, ect). The etch pattern of your meteorite ring may be less sharp, over time. If this occurs, the ring can be re-etched.\r\n \r\nMeteorites do contain some nickel therefore if you have a nickel allergy please be aware that this could cause an allergic reaction if it is placed directly against the skin.\r\n\r\nUnder NO circumstances can I be held responsible if your meteorite rusts when it has left my possession. Why? I have no control over how it is handled once it has left my possession. All meteorite rings leave my possession rust free. If it starts to rust once in your possession then I cannot be held responsible.\r\n\r\nMETEORITE IMPERFECTIONS:\r\nMeteorites are almost never &quot;perfect&quot;. Please expect that there might be small imperfections/marks/inclusions visible in the meteorite, these natural inclusions in the Meteorite these are called Troilite they are just like having a knot in wood, making each piece unique. Meteorites are formed as they travel through space and millions of years later they may land on earth. IF YOU PREFER A PERFECT METEORITE, please purchase it here: https://www.etsy.com/listing/169100646/to-purchase-perfect-meteorite-for-your?ref=shop_home_active_1&ga_search_query=Perfect%2BMeteorite\r\n\r\nMETEORITE CARE (without rustproofing): \r\nIf your meteorite starts rusting then you may have exposed it to an acid. Acid triggers rusting.\r\nCare must be taken to keep meteorite away from chemicals (chlorine, bleach, swimming pools, etc.) especially anything with an acid in it.\r\n\r\nRead more about Meteorite care here: http://jewelrybyjohan.com/meteorite-care/\r\n \r\nMaterials Needed:\r\n1 Old Toothbrush\r\nToothpaste\r\n90% Rubbing Alcohol\r\n1 Small cup\r\nPaper Towels\r\nGun Oil (Optional)\r\nStep 1: Apply small amount of toothpaste to the Toothbrush, and scrub the meteorite gently. Rinse off the toothpaste with water. Repeat if necessary.\r\nStep 2: Place the ring in the small cup and fully submerge with the Alcohol, and allow to soak for 30 minutes.\r\nStep 3: Remove the ring from the alcohol and dab dry with a paper towel, allow to air dry for at least 15-20 minutes.\r\nStep 4: Our iron meteorite rings can be lightly coated with gun oil, as this will help repel water and potential rusting.\r\n \r\n NEW!! - METEORITE - RING  Rust Proofing Service - $39.00\r\nPlease use the following link to purchase the Rust Proofing:\r\n \r\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/130426896/meteorite-rustproofing?ref=shop_home_active&ga_search_query=rustproofing\r\n \r\nRust Proofing Instructions:\r\n1.

It was named after the nearest town: Gibeon, Namibia. The term Gibeon encompasses the whole meteoritic material fallen from the sky during this fall. This material is classified as iron meteorite belonging to the chemical group IVA. Gibeon meteorites are composed of an iron-nickel alloy containing significant amounts of cobalt and phosphorus. The crystal structure of this meteorite provides a classic example of fine octahedrite and the Widmanstatten pattern is appreciated for its beauty both by collectors and designers of jewelry\r\n\r\n5) PET ASHES\r\n=================================\r\nPlease contact us for more information.\r\n\r\n6) GRANITE \r\n=================================\r\nWe would need the granite to be at least 1.5&quot;x1.5&quot; in length and diameter, and at the thinnest part 3&quot; to 5&quot; thick. Without any cracks, or breaks in the granite. \r\n \r\n7) COPPER AND SILVER MOKUME GANE\r\n =================================\r\nIn some cases, Copper and Silver Mokume Gane can cause an allergic reaction if placed directly on the skin. Please be aware of this when you purchase a ring that has this material as the entire band or the inner sleeve.\r\n\r\n8) PETRIFIED WOOD\r\n =================================\r\nSimilar to the Dinobone all petrified woods are different in color, we will send you samples of what we currently have in stock for you to approve for use in your ring. We do not have the same colors as what is shown in the listing, and there is no way for us to control the color variations.\r\n\r\n\r\n =================================\r\nETHICAL SOURCING \r\n =================================\r\nWe only purchase our materials through well respected suppliers who state they are ethically sourced. If it were brought to our attention that our supplier is not abiding by this, we would no longer do business with them.\r\n\r\n =================================\r\nSETTING OF ANY STONE:\r\n =================================\r\nWe can place a stone in a bezel setting in the following materials:\r\nAny precious metals, Titanium, Damascus, Stainless, Copper Silver Mokume, Composites, Woods, Antler, Star Dust and Meteorite.\r\n \r\nWe can place a prong setting into non-lapidary rings that have the base (inner band) a metal. \r\n\r\nTension and Flush set rings will not leave my studio unless it has passed all my tests preventing the stone from falling out. If you are concerned please don&#39;t use an expensive stone.\r\n\r\nIf you send us your ring and ask us to remove the stone then you must accept that the ring will be damaged/cut so that the stone can be removed.\r\n\r\nWe accept NO responsibility for any stone or one supplied by you for setting in a ring if lost or damaged at any time.\r\n\r\nOnce it has left our premises it has to be insured by your own insurance, paid by you. No claim can be made against us if the stone is lost/damaged by whatever means or reason, at any time.\r\n\r\nPlease do NOT send me a stone or ring/s with stone if you do NOT accept the above-mentioned about stones sent to me!!.\r\n\r\n =================================\r\nINTERCHANGEABLE RINGS: \r\n =================================\r\nThe interchangeable ring consists of two titanium parts that keep the inlay securely between it, forming a single solid NON-COMFIT fit ring, but also comes apart very easily when you’re changing the inlay.\r\n\r\nTake a look at this listing http://www.etsy.com/listing/68755906 In the description it gives an explanation of the Interchangeable Rings with pictures.\r\n\r\nJewelry by Johan Interchangeable Ring Instructions:\r\n. Lightly grip metal rims of the ring.\r\n. Twist ring apart (counterclockwise) making sure not to squeeze the rims or inlays too tightly.\r\n. Remove inlay(s) from ring . Lightly wipe wood inlay(s) with Linseed oil to clean and preserve.\r\n. Clean ring, without inlay(s),with a small amount of dish soap and warm water using a toothbrush making sure to clean the threads of debris.\r\n. Allow ring to dry before reassembling. Hair dryer(METAL ONLY) accelerates the process.\r\n. Place Inlay(s), starting with the smallest, onto Part B (Threaded on the inside).\r\n. Lightly insert Part A (Threaded on the outside) into Part B.\r\n. Twist as if unscrewing applying a little pressure. When you feel the threads line up with a click, reverse direction and screw the ring together making sure to not to over tighten.\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD to Unscrew Interchangeable ring.\r\nInsert your right hand index finger into the ring so that the seam points towards the end of your finger, push it on so that it is on firmly, not too tight.\r\nWith your left hand grip the outside metal part of the ring, the side nearest to the end of your index finger.\r\nWhile holding the ring with your left hand, twist your index finger anti-clock wise, the one inside the ring, anti-clock wise, it should come undone.\r\nIf it does not want to come apart, take the ring off your finger, turn it around and repeat the instructions again.\r\nIf it does not come apart then you might not have an Interchangeable ring, contact me so I can check the documents what you have.\r\n\r\n============================================================\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t purchase from Jewelrybyjohan if you don&#39;t accept all and everything mentioned in my Policy.\r\n\r\nJewelrybyjohan reserves the right to revise any and all policies deemed necessary without prior notice.",

Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles.\n\nWhiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too.\nThe Whiskey Stones are Dishwasher safe.\n\nStill thinking and in need of more ideas?

I add new items weekly so please Favorite my shop so you are the first to see the new arrivals.\nhttps://www.etsy.com/shop/TheUltimateManShop",

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference.  On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.**\r\n\r\n**Shipping within the US**  We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship.  We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you.  We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers.\r\n\r\n**Shipping to Canada**  To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail.  Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price.  \r\n\r\n**For Shipping everywhere else**  We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International.  We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive.  However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence.  We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
"policy_refunds": "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping).  Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap.  Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases.  Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service.  We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
"policy_additional": "FAQs - \r\n\r\nDo you have any coupon codes for discounts?  \r\n\r\nYes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015.\r\n\r\n**Super Fall Sale!**\r\n\r\nFALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75\r\nFALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185\r\nFALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185\r\n(Only 1 code can be applied per order). \r\n\r\nHow long will it take for my order to be dispatched?\r\n\r\nWe know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast.  Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks.  This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer.  Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October).  Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you.  \r\n\r\nDo you accept Custom Orders?\r\n\r\nYes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you.\r\n\r\nI need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do?\r\n\r\nPlease contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you.  We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget.\r\n\r\nCan you provide a proof first?\r\n\r\nWe don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings.  However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request.\r\n\r\nWhat Fonts do you offer for the engraving?\r\n\r\nYou can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.\r\n\r\nWe have an Official US Marine Corps Hobbyist License #31499",

Until an item is paid for, it remains available to other buyers, so if you have items in your cart that are near and dear to your heart, please proceed to checkout at your earliest convenience to avoid disappointment.\r\n\r\nIf you order something by mistake, or change your mind after choosing an item from my shop, please be considerate of other shoppers and let me know right away, so that I can cancel the sale, and make the item available to them once again.  Once an item has been shipped, the sale cannot be cancelled until the item is returned to my shop.",
"policy_shipping": "Etsy has now gone &#39;live&#39; with an interactive shipping calculator, so shipping costs for items can be calculated directly from the listing.  I am in the process of updating my listings to enable this feature for all listings, but this may take some time, so please be patient with me.  The new system is wonderful, but it&#39;s not perfect.  For instance it cannot take into account items that can be stacked or placed inside each other, such as bowls or plates.  If you are buying plates or bowls, or other items which stack well or fit inside each other for shipping, it is very likely that shipping will cost less than the amount the shipping calculator quotes to you.  It is not my intention to make money on shipping, and I charge only the actual cost of packaging and shipping.  It is my policy to refund to the buyer any shipping overcharge that exceeds one dollar.\r\n\r\nIf you believe the shipping calculated for a particular item is in error, please take a moment to send me a message, and I&#39;ll check into it.\r\n\r\nI generally ship by FedEx Ground Home Delivery or USPS Priority, whichever is less expensive.  If your address is a post office box, FedEx cannot deliver to you, and I will then ship by USPS Priority.  In cases in which your package is particularly large and/or heavy, USPS Parcel Select may be a more economical, albeit slower method.  There is, of course, no charge for local pickup.  If you prefer a particular shipping method, I will do my best to accommodate your wishes.",

"title": "Apple Watch Double Wrap Band Strap (Whiskey Brown) | Full Grain Vegetable Tanned Leather | Made in USA",
"description": "Show off your Apple Watch with this beautiful, handcrafted leather double wrap band that&#39;s made in USA. This watch band is made with full grain vegetable tanned leather from one of the oldest tanneries in the US. We handcraft this watch band in the heart of Texas and most of the materials are sourced from the US. We hand stitch our watch band using a time-honored saddle-stitch method which is much stronger and longer lasting than the &quot;lock-stitch&quot; method used with sewing machines. \nThis leather double wrap band can be worn two different ways: double-sided on one side (left or right) or double sided between the watch face. This wrap watch band is made in Texas and sourced from materials right here in the US (aside from the Apple Watch adapter).\nThe Apple Watch leather wrap will beautifully age with character over time due to the full-grain leather.\n\nLeather Color - Whiskey Brown\nBuckle/Loops Color - Antique Brass, Polished, or Black (PVD coated)\n\nFeatures\n\n• English bridle full-grain vegetable tanned leather (~4-5oz.)\n• Hand burnished edges\n• Waxed polyester thread (hand saddle stitched)\n• Hand cut & sewn design\n• Stainless steel Apple watch adapter\n• Solid brass buckle and loops\n• Handmade in Texas\n\nSize\nThis Apple Watch Double Wrap Band fits wrist sizes from ~135mm to ~165mm (the average sizes for most small/medium women&#39;s wrists). Please check your wrist size before ordering.\nThis watch band is made of vegetable tanned full grain leather, please expect the band to have an initial tight/stiff fit. The band will break-in over time and feel like it was custom fitted to you!\n\n\nApple Watch Adapter\nThe included stainless steel Apple Watch adapters come in three options: Black, Silver, or Gold\nWe recommend the following adapters to match the Apple Watch model you have:\nSpace Grey Sport - Black adapter\nSpace Black SS - Black adapter\nAluminum Sport - Silver adapter\nStainless Steel - Silver adapter\nRegular Gold Sport - Gold or Black adapter\nRose Gold Sport - Gold or Black adapter\n\n\nBecause these watch bands are handmade, it may take up to 5 business days before it&#39;s shipped to you.\n\nThis product is made of full grain leather and some marks or scars may be present on the leather. Due the variations in leather color, computers monitors, etc. the leather color may appear up to 20% different than the product photos.\n\n*The Apple Watch shown in the photos is not included, this listing is for the watch band and adapter only*",
