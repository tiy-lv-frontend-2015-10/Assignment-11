policy_additional: "Owing to the sudden growth of our international business (thank you Etsy!), the brother in our team has opened a very, very little work shop in Hong Kong. This effort not only moves us closer to some of our suppliers, but also allows us to ship international orders to Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc. including much of Europe, South America... cheaper and faster. North American customers, mainly USA and Canada, will not be affected by this addition, for you good folks, it&#39;s business as usual: engraved and shipped from Houston, Texas. Yee Haw! This concept looked good on paper, let&#39;s hope it pays off- wish us luck! Lastly, for items with multiple colors, for example journals, since our suppliers cannot keep accurate stock levels, we may substitute your purchase with the same product in a different stocked color. *Expedited orders, large orders or orders with not stock in the USA will come from our Hong Kong shop. We reserve the right to ship from either shops. ",

On those made in the USA within a week. No item is limited in quantity unless it states as such in the listing. Inquire for exact availability. Want more than listed? Please convo me. I&#39;ll tell you what the turn around time is in getting more from the manufacturer. PS: Pricing on charms can be very different from one to the next. My pricing is based on what the charms cost me, metal content, where they are made, and how many I have to inventory to keep up with sales. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Shipping charges listed are for the first item purchased. Additional items are shipped at VERY reduced cost. For example, with charms, shipping is $2.50 for the first charm and 3 cents for each additional charm. Calculation of combined shipping is automatic. You will see the cost for shipping before you have to pay. NOTE: PURCHASING EXPEDITED SHIPPING ON FRIDAY, SATURDAY, OR SUNDAY WILL NOT GIVE YOU AN ADVANTAGE! As stated in the option, Expedited shipping is only available on WEEKDAYS! Shipping to USA, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK. I ship everything via US or INTERNATIONAL FIRST CLASS MAIL unless otherwise requested and purchased. FREE SHIPPING via US Priority Mail within the US on orders over $100. Enter Coupon Code: FREE100 DELIVERY OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA takes 2-4 weeks, about half that for shipments to Canada. NOTE: TRACKING ENDS AT THE U.S. BORDER. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; BEST ADVICE to browsers in my shop--READ the ENTIRE LISTING and VIEW ALL PHOTOS. Most answers to common questions are located within the listing. If a question is asked, I try to answer it in the listing with words or photos. - PHOTOS SHOW all sides of a charm - PHOTOS SHOW size next to an inch ruler and relative to a US Quarter Coin IMPORTANT NOTE: The Larger or more diverse your order is, the longer it will take to ship. This is a one person outfit. Please be patient. Your selections are pulled out of bins to add to your order one item at a time--by an OLD LADY with BIFOCALS--all by myself. I am CLOSED MONDAYS so that I can pack/ship all the orders that come in over the weekend. ONLY THE SHOP IS CLOSED. SHIPPING STILL OCCURS ON MONDAYS. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; FULL DISCLOSURE REGARDING METAL COMPOSITION OF CHARMS AND BRACELETS The MATERIAL OF MANUFACTURE is stated in each of my listings. I offer metal, resin, plastic, and rubber charms and bracelets. My metal charms are solid metal, identified within the listing. Many of the charms are colored with enamel. I don&#39;t sell glass charms because they break too easily. My metal charms are LEAD AND NICKEL FREE and are made of pewter (an alloy of tin) or zinc alloy. Most are plated with silver or rhodium (ultra shiny relative of platinum), and are stated as such in the listing. If the plating is sterling silver (92.5% silver), it is noted in the listing. I DO NOT sell any solid sterling silver charms (too expensive!) My charms that are made in the USA are marked as such within the listings. USA manufacturers are very candid about the content of their charms, because verification and certification is REQUIRED BY US LAW. There is no such restriction on imported charms, including honest identification of core, plating, and lead and nickel content. BEWARE of sellers who sell sterling PLATED charms as SOLID sterling silver. Solid sterling silver is REQUIRED BY US LAW to show the number 925. Ask to see the 925 impression which will be molded right onto the piece. Unfortunately, some of the cheap Asian knockoffs display a fraudulent 925 mark. Also, the asking price of the charms is ONLY SOMETIMES a good indicator as to whether it&#39;s sterling silver or not. Solid 925 silver is much more expensive than everything but gold or platinum. If the price listed seems too good to be true, then it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s not solid 925 sterling silver; however, some disreputable sellers still claim their pieces to be solid 925 sterling and charge the high prices. By the way...Real SILVER TARNISHES and will leave black residue on your skin--especially if it is on a ring. Most charms imported from Asia are indeed plated with silver, but not 925 silver and it is plated VERY THINLY. The plating may chip off if you bend the charm or grip it with jeweler&#39;s pliers. The core of Asian charms is usually an alloy of zinc (dull white in color), but I have found several charms that have a plastic core. If I find that one of my charms has a plastic core, I discontinue it immediately. An alternative to plating with silver is plating with RHODIUM (a relative of platinum.) The advantage of rhodium is that it DOES NOT TARNISH, so on wedding rings that are made from silver, the jeweler will plat with rhodium to prevent tarnishing and that black ring around your finger. The disadvantage of rhodium is that it is a shiny white color that some people don&#39;t like. Other sellers are offering charms they claim to be PEWTER.

policy_welcome: "Welcome to intothewoodscharms! Out policies are pretty simple, but cover the needs of most customers. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; BEST ADVICE to browsers in my shop--READ the ENTIRE LISTING and VIEW ALL PHOTOS. Most answers to common questions are located within the listing. If a question is asked, I try to answer it in the listing with words or photos. - PHOTOS SHOW all sides of a charm - PHOTOS SHOW size next to an inch ruler and relative to a US Quarter Coin IMPORTANT NOTE: The Larger or more diverse your order is, the longer it will take to ship. This is a one person outfit. Please be patient. Your selections are pulled out of bins to add to your order one item at a time--by an OLD LADY with BIFOCALS--all by myself. I am CLOSED MONDAYS so that I can pack/ship all the orders that come in over the weekend. ONLY THE SHOP IS CLOSED. SHIPPING STILL OCCURS ON MONDAYS. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Shipping charges listed are for the first item purchased. Additional items are shipped at VERY reduced cost. For example, with charms, shipping is $2.50 for the first charm and 3 cents for each additional charm. Calculation of combined shipping is automatic. You will see the cost for shipping before you have to pay. Shipping to USA, Argentina, Australia, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK. I ship everything via US or INTERNATIONAL FIRST CLASS MAIL unless otherwise requested and purchased. Cost of shipping is determined by weight. FREE SHIPPING via US Priority Mail within the US on orders over $100. Enter Coupon Code: FREE100 DELIVERY OUTSIDE NORTH AMERICA takes 2-4 weeks, about half that for shipments to Canada. NOTE: TRACKING ENDS AT THE U.S. BORDER. &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; FULL DISCLOSURE REGARDING METAL COMPOSITION OF CHARMS AND BRACELETS The MATERIAL OF MANUFACTURE is stated in each of my listings. I offer metal, resin, plastic, and rubber charms and bracelets. My metal charms are solid metal, identified within the listing. Many of the charms are colored with enamel. I don&#39;t sell glass charms because they break too easily. My metal charms are LEAD AND NICKEL FREE and are made of pewter (an alloy of tin) or zinc alloy. Most are plated with silver or rhodium (ultra shiny relative of platinum), and are stated as such in the listing. If the plating is sterling silver (92.5% silver), it is noted in the listing. I DO NOT sell any solid sterling silver charms (too expensive!) My charms that are made in the USA are marked as such within the listings. USA manufacturers are very candid about the content of their charms, because verification and certification is REQUIRED BY US LAW. There is no such restriction on imported charms, including honest identification of core, plating, and lead and nickel content. BEWARE of sellers who sell sterling PLATED charms as SOLID sterling silver. Solid sterling silver is REQUIRED BY US LAW to show the number 925. Ask to see the 925 impression which will be molded right onto the piece. Unfortunately, some of the cheap Asian knockoffs display a fraudulent 925 mark. Also, the asking price of the charms is ONLY SOMETIMES a good indicator as to whether it&#39;s sterling silver or not. Solid 925 silver is much more expensive than everything but gold or platinum. If the price listed seems too good to be true, then it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s not solid 925 sterling silver; however, some disreputable sellers still claim their pieces to be solid 925 sterling and charge the high prices. By the way...SILVER TARNISHES and will leave black residue on your skin--especially if it is on a ring. Most charms imported from Asia are indeed plated with silver, but not 925 silver and it is plated VERY THINLY. The plating may chip off if you bend the charm or grip it with jeweler&#39;s pliers. The core of Asian charms is usually an alloy of zinc (dull white in color), but I have found several charms that have a plastic core. If I find that one of my charms has a plastic core, I discontinue it immediately. An alternative to plating with silver is plating with RHODIUM (a relative of platinum.) The advantage of rhodium is that it DOES NOT TARNISH, so on wedding rings that are made from silver, the jeweler will plat with rhodium to prevent tarnishing and that black ring around your finger. The disadvantage of rhodium is that it is a shiny white color that some people don&#39;t like. Other sellers are offering charms they claim to be PEWTER. Pewter manufactured OUTSIDE THE USA, may CONTAIN LEAD. Pewter charms manufactured in the USA contain NO LEAD, and are verified as such (lead free). All of my pewter charms are manufactured in the USA. As to the ENAMEL: Most of my enamel charms are colored with HEAT SET (in a kiln) enamel.

I strive to bring as as much dedication and precision as one person can provide, trying to deliver a continuously evolving body of work. My goal is to make sure every purchase you make with me is original, inspiring, and hassle free. Your patronage is very warmly welcome. Functional ceramic work is dishwasher, and microwave safe, (if you have any issue in this area please contact me) and most of it could be put in the oven, but unless specified it&#39;s probably best to forgo that treatment.",

Paypal is a well trusted site that gives you the option to pay through a paypal account you may already have, or by credit or debit card. When redirected to the paypal payment page be sure to look at all your options before checking out.

I will try to provide you with tracking information to your email. Shipping takes time and I thank you for you patience, I am one person.

If your anything like me you don&#39;t mind waiting a few days for something great. Please offer any specifics about your shipping address if this needs to be related to the carrier (example: beware of dog, door around back, that kind of thing). If you purchase on a weekend it may take more time to process. I do not ship overseas at this time, sorry.",

You have two weeks from date of delivery to report a problem in order to receive a financial refund (after which only credit towards items in my shop will be given). Please keep in mind due to the unique handmade nature of my work there will always be some variations among sets or multiples. As with all ceramics or prints, though the object may be the same, glazes and reprints always come out a little different. *In the case of breakage during shipping, please document the products condition in photograph and keep the packaging (carries will require this for insurance claims). Please provide me with as much detail as possible so I can avoid future mishandling. If the product fails because of manufacture defects don&#39;t hesitate to open a dialogue with me so we can make it right. In most cases, exact replacement will not be possible so credit towards other items in stock or a new commission** is available. (**case by case basis applies)",

Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs. OAK BARREL INFO: There are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete): • As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking. • In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. • To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. • Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry. • Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. • Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. • As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. • You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. • Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. • If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. • For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use. • The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks. Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39; Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process! Angel’s Share. Angel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot; Storing your Empty Barrel After Initial Use Ideally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. An alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. ",

title: "2 Jameson Rocks Glasses Hand-Cut From One Liter Bottles - Cup Candle Holder Whiskey Whisky Ireland Irish",
description: "Here are two custom-cut Jameson Irish Whiskey rocks glasses from one liter bottles. The possibilities are endless for their uses: - Jameson Whiskey (of course!) - Whiskey Sour (or your choice of cocktails. Shoot, make an Old Fashioned if you&#39;re feeling frisky!) - candle holder - paper clip storage - drinking glass - small vase - shelf doodad (yep, I went there) - paper weight **** As an Etsy special, I will include floating candle holders and wicks. You can use a small amount of vegetable oil and water to turn these rocks glasses into no-mess candles (it&#39;s a cool, cool effect.) **** The John Jameson name, Product of Ireland, JJ&S and two boxers are all molded into the glasses. These all make the glasses a distinct and easily recognizable Jameson items. Each glass holds approximately 9oz of liquid. They are approx 2 3/4&quot; high by 3 1/2&quot; wide. I have a number of bottles that can be custom-cut into rocks glasses or tumblers https://www.etsy.com/listing/234776586 You can also order one, three or four rocks glasses: - One for $8 https://www.etsy.com/listing/234782026 - Three for $18 https://www.etsy.com/listing/234783182 - Four for $24 https://www.etsy.com/listing/234783450 The lips of the glasses are super-smooth with a mouth-feel that is indistinguishable from heat annealed glass you would get at any high-end housewares store. I have gone to great lengths to ensure these glasses will arrive intact. Professional shipping that includes bubble wrap and biodegradable packing peanuts is utilized in all of my shipments. Please be sure to check out my other Doodads (many of which include re-purposing bottles into soap dispensers, Porch Torches, patio string lights and pendant lights.) I have reduced shipping as much as possible when you order multiple items. Soap Dispensers: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DavesDoodads?section_id=17050606 Pendant Lights: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DavesDoodads?section_id=17050594 Porch Torches: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DavesDoodads?section_id=17049453 Beer String Lights: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DavesDoodads?section_id=17050604 Glasses: https://www.etsy.com/shop/DavesDoodads?section_id=17087593 Thank you for checking out my stuff!

Expedited services are available for an extra cost. The shipping cost listed includes the cost of postage plus the cost of packaging materials. We ship via USPS First Class within 2-3 business days after payment. USPS Priority (2-3 days) and Express (next day) are available for US orders for an additional charge. If you need either of those options please request via Etsy conversation BEFORE purchasing. Buyers are responsible for providing the correct mailing information.

Once your order is shipped out, if it is returned to us because of an incorrect name or address, or you simply did not pick it up from your post office in time, it will be your responsibility to pay the additional shipping cost to have it mailed again. US ORDERS: Most orders in the US arrive within 5-7 business days. INTERNATIONAL ORDERS: Import duties and/or taxes may apply. Buyer is responsible for these fees charged by their home country. If you are unsure of your import allowances and/or responsibilities set by your home country, please take a moment to check this with your country&#39;s customs office prior to completing check out. Please be advised that we will NOT falsify customs documents by marking a package as a &quot;gift&quot; on customs forms. All international orders will have full value declared on customs forms and will be marked as &quot;merchandise&quot; - no exceptions. We are not able to purchase delivery confirmation on items shipped internationally. Please allow 2-4 weeks for delivery. If you have not received your order after 4 weeks please contact us at that time to let us know. ",

Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs. OAK BARREL INFO: There are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete): • As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking. • In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. • To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. • Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry. • Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. • Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. • As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. • You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. • Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. • If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. • For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use. • The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks. Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39; Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process! Angel’s Share. Angel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot; Storing your Empty Barrel After Initial Use Ideally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. An alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals. ",

Before buying a leather wrapped flask somewhere else, ask if the wrap is REMOVABLE. Most others are glued to the flask and will cause mold if cleaned in water. Water can also delaminate the wrap if it gets wet. Our handmade leather wraps do not have that problem! ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Each leather wrap is hand dyed for a one of a kind, never duplicated design pattern, and is seal coated for years of use. These wraps are NOT printed on vinyl or paper, but are engraved into the leather. The wrap slides off the flask so you can clean the flask. We have attached photo layouts of all our wedding flasks (scrollwork and oval), just let us know which design you want to use in the ORDER NOTES section. Some popular titles include: GROOM BESTMAN GROOMSMAN USHER FATHER OF THE BRIDE FATHER OF THE GROOM BRIDE MAID OF HONOR MATRON OF HONOR but we will engrave any title you want, so be creative! ************************** IMPORTANT: Three letter monogram note: The traditional three letter monogram is like this: First Name - Last Name - Middle Name.

policy_shipping: "When your order ships, you will receive a convo from us telling you how the package has shipped. We determine if orders are shipping via US Mail or UPS depending on the weight and size of the object being shipped. When we ship by UPS, we have a tracking number provided to us and we pass that number on to you via convo. When we ship via US Mail we most often receive a tracking number, but not always.. If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies. When delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature. Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be. The addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to. If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there. If you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point. Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you. Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount. LOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES: If your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date. The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays. This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you. We have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended. When we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup. UPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor. The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge. CANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer. Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control. INSURANCE: All shipments ARE NOT insured. Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price. Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package. Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.",
policy_refunds: "Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel. Since we make custom items there is the returns for custom made items. Should there be a mistake made by us (Killorglin Creations) such as engraving mistake, wrong color, etc. you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the problem. If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage. We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product. If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable. This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable. We do not want any of our products in use if thy are not up to our standards for quality. We will instruct you how marr and photograph the item. Please also see the above section for refund info.",

We will reopen the store Wed Dec 17th, but any order placed then will not arrive by Christmas. All orders that have been placed on or before Dec 10th will be shipped by Dec 18th, so if you have an order with us already, no need to check on it, we have it and it will be shipped by the 18th. We will send the tracking number to you when the order ships. You can still contact us through this Etsy email. DO NOT USE REGULAR EMAIL - ONLY THIS ETSY EMAIL SYSTEM. Please understand that we are hard at work on your custom order, so please only contact us with important questions, as answering emails takes away from our production time. Reference your ORDER DATE and the name of the person it is being SHIPPED TO. ",

Our Office Manager, Vontrice, is available online between the hours of 9am-5pm Monday thru Friday. **We all have families and enjoy spending time with them on the weekends. RUSH Orders are available but you MUST contact us for approval on your purchase before placing it. ScissorMill also owns & operates a second store on Etsy called PoppinPrint",
policy_payment: " --&gt; Our Office Manager Vontrice is available online between the hours of 9am-5pm Monday thru Friday. **We all have families and enjoy spending time with them on the weekends. RUSH Orders are available but you MUST contact us for approval on your purchase before placing it. ScissorMill only accepts payment from Etsy Direct Checkout & PayPal. You CAN use your credit card through Paypal - you Don&#39;t Have To Have a Paypal Account. eCheck Customers: If you purchase an item through PayPal and use and eCheck your order will not begin production until after your payment has been cleared. When ordering custom items that require a long production time (up to 25 days) please keep in mind the additional time your order will require for the payment to clear and then the order be made.",
policy_shipping: "--&gt;Please contact us about production time. I use the US Postal Service, Priority Mail for 90% my shipping. USPS guarantees 2-3 day delivery with priority mail. A few orders are shipped with FedEx for specific reasons. ---&gt;**You have 5 days from the delivery date (per tracking information) to report broken / missing products. If you are not available to inspect the contents within that time frame, please ask someone to do it for You.** No Exceptions. Since glass is so fragile I must put a limit on the amount of time I am liable for any damages. If You receive an order that has been damaged by shipping, please contact me ASAP and I will replace it free of charge as soon as I possibly can. Sending me pictures of the damages is very helpful so I can collect insurance and help pay for the replacement. ---&gt;If for any reason the address You entered on the invoice was incorrect and Your package is returned to me we will contact You as soon as we can. A private listing will be set up for You to buy the postage a second time with a new shipping address. ---&gt;Once in a while a package is lost, delivered to the wrong address, or delayed. Your patience and understanding is appreciated. When your package leaves our shop it&#39;s fate is in the hands of the shipping service. We are here for you Monday-Friday 9am-5pm PST. If you have questions about tracking please send us a convo. We are happy to help contact USPS or FedEx to help with the delivery. --&gt;You are welcome to pick-up your order from our location. Just ask through the Convo System Before you purchase.",
policy_refunds: "Before you leave negative feedback I would appreciate the chance to fix, replace, or refund a product if you are not satisfied. It&#39;s very important to me that you enjoy your purchase. Don&#39;t be afraid to talk with us. Custom items are non-returnable.",
policy_additional: "The products I create are very important to me. It weighs on my conscience when a customer is unhappy with their purchase. I spend a lot of time designing and creating each specific order. If my product makes a positive impression there is a good chance ScissorMill will be recommended to others and keep my business strong. I am constantly aware of this and very grateful for the positive feedback that I receive. COMMUNICATION: We contact all customers through the Etsy &quot;Convo&quot; system. *I cannot stress enough how important it is that you convey every detail you would like to have personalized. We offer designs to choose from - which can all be altered (within reason) to fit your need. However, never assume I &quot;would know&quot; how you want it. It is always best to send us a convo through Etsy to verify we can make what you need. Public listings do not receive a proof before production. CUSTOMER RESPONSIBILITIES: - Slow down and Read my Listing Descriptions & Policies before you purchase. - Log into Etsy to access your Convos for confirmation, questions & updates - Communicate with us through the Etsy Convo system - Read your order confirmation Convo with shipping date (these are sent within 48 hours of every order that is placed) - Read & Abide by my shipping Policies - Verify the shipping address is correct - YOU are responsible for making sure we receive the correct address to which you want your package sent. - For Custom/Private Listings: If you approve the proof we send - that is exactly how your item will be made - regardless of previous conversations. You must take the time to proof-read them and point out the errors if you find any. - Understand that you are ordering CUSTOM products. Each one is designed and produced individually. **This takes time** ",
