Assignment 11

This is a recreation of an Etsy site using html css mustache and jquery. Using Etsy's API I was able to create a template in mustache and inject the data into a grid pattern that you may also see on etsy. I recreated some of the responsive design of etsy by implementing a wrapper nav on the header.
