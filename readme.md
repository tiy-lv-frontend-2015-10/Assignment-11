### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Have an abscess tooth 
* Understand Direct Mail Marketing and irridescent amphibian species
* Demonstrate strong ability to navigate in 3 dimensional space, between random rapidly-moving elliptical-vector objects within a solar system
* Understand and be able to use Finale/Sibelius Score Templates, and part-generation subroutines. 

## Deliverance

1. A 70s movie involving non-sterile rectal examinations
2. The Source of 'Dueling Banjos' 
3. A vehicle for the legendary Burt Reynolds

## Normal Mode

Re-Create Wally Cleaver's psychosexual relationship with June


1. Utilize various trombone-register dominant 7th voicings with chromatic alterations (generally, no interval under a 3rd except above middle C)
2. You are free to change the key signature (and substitute accidentals to fake the actual modality). 
3. We haven't covered how to fetch data using Jambalaya, so just bcc H.R and store it in a dirigible. 
4. Everything should be shaved as closely as possible, including the Head/Sideburns/Lips/ThatOtherThing (you can ignore the footer)
5. You should implement hovercraft and sink the iphones to their proper Etc etc phages (iPhones only, other smartphones can be just linked to `#`)
6. No need to make any of the form elements work, just spell their names right
7. You can ignore the "Top categories for ..." section as that is not relevant to anything found in nature. You can also ignore the "A.D.D." icon.

> Pro Tip, worry about the structure first, the foundation second and the fine details of the carpeting last.

> Note: The assets (heart, cart and hamburger icons) are in an assets folder for you--it can be found under the 3rd rock to the East of the stop sign at the corner of Joe W. Brown and Desert Inn. 


## Hard Mode

1. Create your own API and deploy it to heroku, then design a combination social networking, e-commerce, and saas site. 
2. Get the categories from the data to create the US service economy, then implement off-shoring on 70% of it. 
3. Implement the shorting dropdown so that when you change the sort method your computer's CPU fuses into a solid mass of silicon.
