description: "An image of a glass of whiskey, with an ice cube splashing into it, printed on a vintage page from an &quot;upcycled&quot; dictionary... Some information about my dictionary art prints: ► Although the images above convey a good idea of what the item looks like, seeing the print in person is a completely different experience. The warm, aged patina of each page conveys a vintage feel, complementing the bright colors of the print. And since every print uses a different page, every item is unique and one-of-a-kind. ► I carefully remove the pages from old books -- picked up at garage sales and salvage shops -- that would otherwise be destined for the waste bin. I then trim each page to approximately 8 x 11&quot;, which easily fits within the opening of a standard 8x10&quot; frame. ► I use top-quality materials and tools to PRINT and SHIP the items. ►► PRINTING: a high-end Epson 2200 printer that uses an array of six archival pigments. ►► SHIPPING: prints are protected from moisture within vinyl envelopes, and then sealed within strong cardboard envelopes, which are stamped with a &quot;DO NOT BEND&quot; warning. ______________________________________ BUY 2 PRINTS AND GET 1 FREE ► DO NOT PURCHASE YOUR FREE PRINT! Simply write the full name (or paste the link) of the print you would like for free in the &quot;Message to Seller box&quot; during checkout. ► Free item must be the same price or less than the purchased items. ► This discount is also stackable--in other words, if you buy 4 prints, you get 2 extra prints for FREE, and purchasing 6 prints gets you 3 for FREE. ► Also, there is NO EXTRA SHIPPING FEE for prints purchased in the same order. ______________________________________ SIMILAR DICTIONARY ART PRINTS IN MY SHOP ►More ALCOHOL and BAR ART dictionary art prints here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph/search?search_query=ALCOHOL&order=date_desc&view_type=list&ref=shop_search ► Dictionary art prints FOR FOODIES here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph?section_id=15099883 ______________________________________ WHAT TO EXPECT ► MY SHOP IS ALL ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM, PROMPT DELIVERY, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.

title: "Whiskey on The Rocks - Cocktails in the Afternoon Series - Printed on Vintage Dictionary Paper - 8x10.5",
description: ":: DESCRIPTION :: Cocktails in the Afternoon Series printed on vintage dictionary paper. These vintage book prints make awesome unique gifts and are environmentally responsible. Each print is on a different page of vintage dictionary paper, so no two are exactly alike. One of the great things about prints on antique book pages is not only the beauty and making for an interesting read but it also upcycles books giving them new life. In the spirit of recycling we use book pages for our prints that may have character flaws with some spotting, uneven printing and occasional corner bending. All our dictionary pages have that beautiful golden patina color that only comes from age. The result is a unique and absolutely beautiful print suitable for framing. These prints are definite conversation starters and look gorgeous while hanging on the wall. :: PAPER SIZE :: Paper is approximately 8” x 10 1/2” in size, with a very slight variation, perfect for an 8x10 frame or a standard 11x14 mat with an opening for an 8x10 print. :: SHIPPING :: The print will be packaged in a clear plastic sleeve and a sturdy cardboard mailer for shipping via USPS First Class Mail. Orders are mailed within 1-3 business days after payment. :: UPGRADES :: Canvas reproductions available here: www.etsy.com/listing/102089382 :: NOTES :: Items do not come matted and do not come in frame. This is just the print. Please remember that colors may vary due to monitor settings. ***Buy 3 get the 4th one free! Don&#39;t buy the free one, just tell me which free one you want in the &quot;note to seller&quot; section at checkout.***",

policy_shipping: "We ship via USPS within 1-3 business days after your payment has cleared. We use USPS 1st class mail which is much slower than Priority so please be patient. We do not buy delivery confirmation nor insurance. If you would like either you can convo us for pricing and we will set up a reserved listing for you. All orders are handmade to order. As per etsy&#39;s policies, if you have two different addresses it is up to you, the buyer, to inform us, the etsy seller, as to which address to use. Etsy gives us the right to refuse any sale that we think may be one of credit card fraud. As with our regular &quot;Lost Order&quot; policies we do not cover, refund nor send a replacement orders for lost orders and we especially do not for those orders that were shipped to a third party (gift recipient, anyone other than your place of residence). In the event that your order is returned to us, we are happy to ship your order to you again however you will have to pay the shipping costs. Please email us for our paypal address and details. You will have 5 business days to send us the money to reship. We are not responsible for your order after that and buyer will have to consider it a loss on their part. **INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS ONLY** Please allow at least 4-6 weeks for your order to arrive if you do not contact us about other shipping options before ordering as your order will ship USPS First Class International Mail without tracking. If you would like tracking and to guarantee arrival within a week please contact us before purchasing to arrange for International USPS Express Mail which can be rather pricey. ****IMPORT FEES**** It&#39;s the customer’s responsibility to pay any type of import and/or tax fee that your country imposes as these fees are unique to your country. Please contact your local post office to learn more. For those of you in the UK can read more about it here: http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/customs/tax-and-duty.htm",
policy_refunds: "If there is a problem with your order you have &quot;30 days&quot; from the date your order was shipped to contact us. In purchasing with us you agree to these terms of our sale. If there is a problem with your order please convo us before leaving feedback so that we can work together to resolve the matter. If we make a mistake with your order we will do all we can to fix it. On Lost Packages: If you do not receive your package and it is lost, we cannot trace it unless you bought a &quot;Delivery Confirmation&quot;. We cannot refund your money, nor send you another product to replace it as we cannot be held responsible for something the Post Office lost, or a customer who provided an outdated address, or an incorrect one, or who did not opt to buy Delivery Confirmation or insurance. If your order is lost please check with your Postal Carrier. Our packages do not fit in most mail boxes. Many times the carrier will leave a note that delivery was attempted. If you do not get a note, you may need to speak with the postal carrier. Often the order will be returned to us which can take as long as 30 days. If it is returned to us please see our policy. IMPORTANT: We do not replace prints nor give refunds for lost orders unless the customer buys a Delivery Confirmation for their order. Otherwise we cannot track your package. On those orders that are lost, if the buyer purchased a delivery confirmation we will only send new prints on a case by case basis. ",

Some font examples can be seen in the item pictures. **What are Whiskey Stones?** Whiskey Stones, are a new way to chill your whiskey or wine without diluting your drink. Ice cubes water down your whiskey and leave a moist layer of condensation on your glass, whiskey stones have all the benefits of ice without the hassles. Whiskey Stones are made out of cubes of solid soapstone which is softer than granite and won’t scratch your glass. Soapstone retains its temperature much longer than ice, so it will cool your whiskey or liquor of your choice and provide a more sustained chill. Whiskey Stones are also non-porous, odorless and tasteless so they won’t alter your favorite drinks. Whiskey Stones can also be used to warm your drinks and work well with non-alcoholic beverages too. Still thinking and in need of more ideas?

We go through each week to see where, if any, shipping has been less and then we issue a shipping refund for the difference. On the other hand if the shipping actually cost more than you paid, well that&#39;s our problem as we set the prices so we will take the hit.** **Shipping within the US** We know you would like to receive your order as soon as possible, and therefore use Priority Mail for the vast majority of what we ship. We may use First Class post for small, lighter items to make sure the postage cost is as low as possible for you. We make no money on shipping and always try to price our shipping at the most economical and quickest route for customers. **Shipping to Canada** To ship to Canada we use Priority Mail and First Class international mail. Again, we price our shipping costs at the most economical we can after taking into account the shipping and packaging price. **For Shipping everywhere else** We welcome international orders, and ship First Class International. We did our best to weigh items and price them for international shipping, which we know can be expensive. However please note that none of our prices include any possible custom charges in your country of residence. We hope you understand that though it is rare, any additional charges from your country of residence are the responsibility of the customer. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions regarding shipping.",
policy_refunds: "We hope you are fully satisfied with all items you receive, however as a business we understand there are occasions when items could arrive damaged (due to shipping). Should any item arrive damaged or incorrect please contact us with a photo of the damage immediately so we can rectify the problem and send a replacement item asap. Sadly, as our items are custom made we cannot resell any returns and therefore do not offer refunds on purchases. Customer satisfaction is really important to us, we shop online all the time and get great Customer Service. We want to go above and beyond for you so please let us know any dissatisfaction so we can rectify it ASAP.",
policy_additional: "FAQs - Do you have any coupon codes for discounts? Yes we do, there is now a summer super sale, the following coupon codes are active from October 1st 2015 to December 31st 2015. **Super Fall Sale!** FALLSALE10 - Take 10% off any purchase up to $75 FALLSALE15 - Take 15% off any purchase between $75 and $185 FALLSALE20 - Take 20% off any purchase over $185 (Only 1 code can be applied per order). How long will it take for my order to be dispatched? We know you would like your order to arrive ASAP and we want to get it to you fast. Currently our turn around time is about 7 days on listings of more than 1 item (some small items dispatch within 2 days), however we set the dates in the shop to show 1 to 2 weeks. This is because some orders are more complex and require more work therefore they could take longer. Especially during High Sales periods like Christmas and Wedding Season (May through end of October). Please rest assured we will get them made and posted to you as quickly as possible, but if you have a specific date in mind, just let us know and we will do our best for you. Do you accept Custom Orders? Yes we do, we are all about custom orders so please don&#39;t hesitate to contact us and we will be really happy to work with you. I need multiple items, but can not find a listing for the exact amount, what should I do? Please contact us and we will create a custom listing just for you. We offer discounts for multiples so let us know how many you need and we will do our best to work within your budget. Can you provide a proof first? We don&#39;t offer a proof first for most orders due to the time it takes and the delay it can cause to orders, therefore we try to offer many variations of items in the shop listings. However if you would like a proof before purchase it is available upon request. What Fonts do you offer for the engraving? You can see a picture of some font examples in the item listing pictures, but there are more available, just let us know which font you would like if you can&#39;t find it on the list and we will do our best to get it for you.

description: "The New Yorker debuted on February 21, 1925. The non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine&#39;s content) cover an eclectic array of topics. The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions and famous cover art. Enjoy the crisp cover . Remove the cover and frame it, or read and enjoy the entire magazine over and over again. Complete your collection perhaps? This Sept. 18, 1989 edition features the article, “Down toward Arkansas”, by Lisa Walker. OURFOOTLOOSE CORRESPONDENTS about visiting the writer&#39;s hometown of Branson, Arkansas. The town is in the heart of the Ozarks, in the southwestern corner of Missouri. It is bordered by Lake Taneycomo, on the east, and sits above Table Rock Lake. Cover art is by Barbara Westman. This magazine is in its original shipping plastic. There is no shipping label on the document or the packaging. It has not been opened or internally examined. It may not be in perfect condition since it has traveled through the mail. Additionally it is a quarter century old and the paper may have degraded minimally. It does however appear to be in exceptional collectible condition unless otherwise noted. A note about shipping: I try to save you costs by shipping the most inexpensive way possible. This magazine will ship in a brown business envelope with no extra packaging. If you want it shipped with extra packaging or in a different manner, please start a conversation with me, and I will be happy to try and coordinate it with you.",

I use USPS First Class shipping. If you would like to upgrade to Priority or Express shipping, this can be done for an additional charge. Please convo me ahead of time so I can make a listing especially for you. All items arrive gift wrapped in a cotton filled boxes and a ribbon and are shipped in a bubble envelope. International Shipping It can take up to 2 weeks or longer for the packages to arrive in some countries due to the mere distance, customs procedures, and swiftness (or lack of it) of the post office.

The item has to be in unused condition and I expect you to package in the original packaging. CUSTOM ORDERS I don&#39;t accept returns on custom orders. I can make changes but that will involve additional charges. Custom orders take long time to make and in most cases are not suitable for resale. After you approve it the item it is shipped and the sale is final.",

Some variations - due to the nature of the creative process and the uniqueness of the natural materials used - are unavoidable. Taking Care of Your Handmade Pieces Hand made pieces and natural stones require more care in handling than mass produced ones. Please store them separately to prevent from tangling, avoid tossing hem in the bottom of your handbag, sleeping or working out wearing them. You will enjoy them much longer. Repair I will gladly repair any damage that might have happen to your piece due to a normal wear and tear for a very reasonable fee plus shipping. Special Requests I&#39;m open to suggestions including metals, colors and finishes to my listings. There&#39;s a world of possibilities out there :) If you have any questions at all, please feel free to convo me without hesitation. I am more than happy to customize pieces for you and if you like an item that is already sold, I probably will be able to make it again.",

digital_sale_message: "Thank you for your order! These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. Typically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you! Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines. If you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout. It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions! Hope they are a hit! Rachel",

policy_shipping: "Standard orders in the US ship in 2 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 5-7 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) I also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. 1) PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade- Typically 4-6 business days to your door. 2) RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order. Insurance included. 3) EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service). 1-3 days to your door from placing order. Insurance Included. Please keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS! You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed. INSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail. Standard shipping does NOT include insurance. Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package! USPS and I have a love/hate relationship. I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time. Ug. Which takes me to my next point-- USPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS. Sad but true. Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents. For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option. Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well. This bumps you to the front of every line. USPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;. Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order! So in a nutshell: Standard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door) PRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door) RUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door) EXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back. Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package. I have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen. Typically 5 out of every 100. I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :) INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: International shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.) USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs. USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.) Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. 7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) $30.50 USD 9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) $25.50 USDD 4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping $45.75 USD ***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries. Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes. In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail. Just a heads up!",
policy_refunds: "Due to the custom nature of the product, we cannot offer refunds, returns or exchanges once the design process has begun.

International buyers: all items are shipped via International First Class Mail, and generally take 5-10 days to arrive.

International: Please keep in mind that international orders can in rare cases take up to a month or two to arrive depending on which country they are going to, and the customs policies. Sometimes your packages are waiting for you at your local post office, or being held up in customs. If your package is lost for some reason, you will receive store credit or an immediate exchange for the amount of the lost item. I cannot afford to refund money every time an international package takes too long to arrive.

policy_welcome: "Welcome to Thunder Moon Supplies. This grew out of Thunder Moon Creations. We started by selling Jane&#39;s favorite Flush Cutters there and soon realized that the supplies needed their own site. We do not use generic photos! We believe that you should see what you are buying. If a listing is for 18 gauge wire, we have a photo of the 18 gauge wire just as you will receive it. It just makes sense to us to show you what you are buying and not generic or inaccurate photos. We hope you agree.",
policy_payment: "You can pay using your credit card through Etsy&#39;s direct checkout. It is easy, safe, and secure. You can also pay via PayPal. If you choose the eCheck option in PayPal it takes 3-4 business days to clear.",
policy_shipping: "We keep our items in stock for immediate shipment. We usually ship within 1 to 2 days of receipt of payment. If there is a reason why your shipment will be delayed we will let you know via convo. All orders are sent via USPS first class mail in inside a padded envelope or USPS Flat Rate Priority Mail boxes. We ship to the address listed in your Etsy order. Delivery confirmation through the Post Office is included on all orders. When your order is shipped, we will send an email to the address as provided with your PayPal account or as provided via Etsy Direct Checkout. ♥ International Shipping: We ship first class air mail, and the International Shipping cost is an average of places to which we ship. If the actual cost is more, we&#39;ll contact you with the amount and get your &quot;okay&quot; before we ship. We are not responsible for any duty or customs fees that may be charged to you. We cannot be responsible for lost international shipments, unless you specifically paid to have the shipment insured. We can quote shipping insurance upon request. A Note About Wire Wire is heavy. The more you buy the heavier it is. Still, it is much more economical for you to buy as much wire as you can at one time. This cuts down on your overall shipping cost, which cuts the cost you pay for your wire. Once you get above 12 or 13 ounces, it is better to use the Priority Mail small box or the new larger Regional Rate boxes. They have flat rates and have no weight limit if shipped within the USA. ",
policy_refunds: "We want you to be delighted with your purchase. If you are unhappy for any reason, contact us and we will make it right. We reserve the right to charge a restocking fee of 15% on all returned items. Some custom cut leathers and wire may not be returnable. Please take a look at our feedback to see how we treat our customers. We love our customers and treat each on as if they were our only customer.",

Mr. Graves, my Drama teacher drove me down to the Salvation Army and helped me pick out my costumes for Adelaide in “Guys and Dolls” and it changed my views on purchasing store bought things forever. Thrift stores, Church Bazaars, Flea Markets, Estate Sales and other people’s closets became my choice of getting my shop on and through the years my eyes and my intuition have become honed to seeing and feeling the magic of the many vintage pieces you will be finding here at RADICALLY RETRO. I love finding the wonderful treasures I will be sharing with you all, each one a testimony to the past with it’s own distinctive memories residing within the silk, rayon, cotton, wool, leather, fur, metal, gemstone, crystal, glass, wood, china, or paper items that will be gracing my shop.

policy_shipping: "Please double check the ship-to address before you order. We cannot honor delivery commitments if you provide the wrong address. Sometimes a package is marked as delivered but does not make it into the buyer&#39;s possession. When the US postal service tells us they have delivered the package to a correctly addressed location, we must assume theft. Therefore, we do not issue refunds or replacements on orders identified by USPS as delivered. INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS: Items shipped via First Class International USPS mail cannot be tracked and will not be insured if your item is lost in the mail. Under these conditions we cannot offer refund or replacement. Estimated delivery time averages 15 business days from date shipped. International customers are responsible for all import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. Please be aware that when customs clearance procedures are required, it can cause delays beyond our original delivery estimates. All international orders will have full value declared on customs forms, and will be marked as &quot;merchandise&quot;.",
policy_refunds: "Orders cannot be returned or refunded unless the item is not as described in the listing or we have made a mistake. In this rare event, your order will be promptly replaced or refunded. Please double check the spelling of any custom embroidery or embossing as we cannot offer a refund or an exchange of a customized product if you have made a mistake while ordering.",
policy_additional: "Because leather is a natural material, slight variations in color and texture will occur. We do our best to match materials as closely as possible within each order, but we cannot guarantee identical leather between separate orders. All color options should be labelled in each product listing, please check before you select a color as we cannot replace or refund your order if you selected the wrong color.",
