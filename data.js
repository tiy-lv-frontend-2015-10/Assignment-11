Authentic vintage KARNIG MANN backpack style shoulder bag/tote Genuine soft mahogany brown leather (thick & supple!) with croc embossed accents and silver metal hardware ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚àµ‚à¥ ‚òÜ‚òÖ ‚à¥‚àµ ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚àµ ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚àµ‚à¥ ‚òÜ‚òÖ ‚à¥‚àµ ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚àµ‚à¥ ‚òÜ‚òÖ ‚à¥‚àµ ‚òÖ‚òÜ ‚àµ ‚òÖ‚òÜ . . . . I&#39;ve got over 130 amazing items listed on the other e-site if you&#39;d like to check them out. . . . http://stores.ebay.ca/gibbonisamonkey?_rdc=1 This is such a cool and amazing bag made with obvious high-quality materials and expert craftsmanship. Created with the kind of leather that lasts a lifetime if cared for properly - which this has been! Features: * a zipper closure across the top of the single deep & roomy interior compartment * lined in what feels like coated canvas (?) or just textured vinyl, it&#39;s hard to tell * one fold over flap and snap pocket on the front of the bag, made of stunning glossy croc-embossed smooth leather * one zip pocket just below the flap & snap one (also croc-embossed), unzips right up the middle of the bag into an unusual but handy storage area. * a heavier quality silver metal zipper pull engraved with &quot;Made in Italy&quot; The 40-inch long leather straps on the back run through a horseshoe shaped heavy silver metal ring and buckle at the bottom with 2 metal buckles. The silver has worn off and copper shows underneath. The words &quot;MANN&quot; with a Canadian maple leaf are engraved on each buckle. The straps unzip so you can wear the bag hands-free as a backpack, or do them up and carry the bag as a sling over one shoulder. This medium size bag measures approximately: 11&quot; high 9&quot; across the widest part at the bottom, 6 inches across the top 3&quot; deep at the bottom - the top opens up to 9 inches across when unzipped. with two 40-inch long leather straps (end to end) on the back that unzip in the middle Pre-owned in EXCELLENT vintage condition (in my opinion). Very clean inside and out with some lightened scuffs on the bottom corners. Please look at all of the pictures to make your own determination of the condition and read the fine print below. / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / Shipping to Canadian or U.S. locations is: $ 14.00 (Just message me for a shipping quote if you live elsewhere) / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / No returns, refunds or requests to cancel orders are accepted.

Check out my other items and reviews here: http://stores.ebay.ca/gibbonisamonkey?_rdc=1 All items will be shipped from my non-smoking home . . . However most of my merchandise is PRE-OWNED (used) and/or VINTAGE and was acquired second or third hand so I cannot assure you of the item&#39;s history (unless it is listed as a brand new item). Odors/scents/smells of some sort usually accompany vintage or used items - especially leather - so please keep this in mind. / / / / / Payment is expected within 3 days of purchase / / / / / I ship by Canada Post. Shipping costs are based on weight/size. Most things I sell will be shipped in a poly plastic mailer bag (with tissue paper) to keep costs down. I usually ship within 2 DAYS OF PAYMENT - Monday to Friday only, and NO SHIPPING ON WEEKENDS or HOLIDAYS. If you buy something on a Friday I&#39;ll ship it out on Monday or Tuesday. Economy shipping (no tracking number) takes between 4 - 18 BUSINESS DAYS (that means Monday to Friday).",

policy_welcome: "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. Tyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well. Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company. We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year. We finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference. Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.

description: "An image of two glasses of whiskey (could also be Bourbon or Scotch), printed on a vintage page from an &quot;upcycled&quot; dictionary... ______________________________________ BUY 2 PRINTS AND GET 1 FREE ‚ñ∫ DO NOT PURCHASE YOUR FREE PRINT! Simply write the full name (or paste the link) of the print you would like for free in the &quot;Message to Seller box&quot; during checkout. ‚ñ∫ Free item must be the same price or less than the purchased items. ‚ñ∫ This discount is also stackable--in other words, if you buy 4 prints, you get 2 extra prints for FREE, and purchasing 6 prints gets you 3 for FREE. ‚ñ∫ Also, there is NO EXTRA SHIPPING FEE for prints purchased in the same order. ______________________________________ SIMILAR DICTIONARY ART PRINTS IN MY SHOP ‚ñ∫More ALCOHOL and BAR ART dictionary art prints here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph/search?search_query=ALCOHOL&order=date_desc&view_type=list&ref=shop_search ‚ñ∫ Dictionary art prints FOR FOODIES here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph?section_id=15099883 ______________________________________ ABOUT MY DICTIONARY ART ‚ñ∫ The pages are &quot;upcycled&quot; from old dictionaries (and sometimes other books) that otherwise would be destroyed. ‚ñ∫ The pages, which are delicately yellowed with age, are carefully removed from the dictionary and trimmed to size. Because each page is unique, your work of art will be one-of-a-kind. ‚ñ∫ The images are carefully designed and crafted and then printed on the old dictionary pages using a high-end printer (Epson 2200). ‚ñ∫ I am constantly testing to make sure that the colors, tone, and brightness of the images are correctly balanced against the print on the dictionary page‚ñ∫ These unique prints complement almost any decor -- vintage, modern, apartment or college dorm -- and any room -- office, bedroom, bath, living room, hallway.... ______________________________________ PRINT SIZE ‚ñ∫ Frames and mats are not included. However, the size of the dictionary pages I use are roughly 11&quot; by 8&quot;-8.25&quot;. This will fit in a mat sized for 8x10&quot; prints (which typically have openings of 7.5 x 9.5&quot;). ______________________________________ SHIPPING ‚ñ∫ Prints will be mailed in durable cardboard envelopes, stamped &quot;DO NOT BEND&quot; in red ink. ‚ñ∫ Prints will be shipped via USPS First Class in 2-3 business days, although I try to ship within 24 hours. They typically arrive in 2-3 days. If you want overnight shipping, let me know and I can create a custom order with which you can pay the extra amount. ‚ñ∫ International orders are shipped USPS First Class International. Depending on the customs protocols used in your country, arrival could take anywhere from 7 to 30 days. In order to keep my shipping costs reasonable, I do not provide tracking. ______________________________________ WHAT TO EXPECT ‚ñ∫ MY SHOP IS ALL ABOUT PROFESSIONALISM, PROMPT DELIVERY, AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. IN MOST CASES, YOUR ITEM WILL BE SHIPPED WITHIN 24 HOURS. ‚ñ∫ See my 5-star reviews here: https://www.etsy.com/your/shops/Lexiconograph/reviews?ref=shop_info ‚ñ∫ Visit my Etsy shop here: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Lexiconograph ______________________________________ MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE ‚ñ∫ Each print is created to exacting standards. If you are in any way unsatisfied with the print, let me know, and if we can&#39;t work out any other solution, I&#39;ll be happy to offer you a FULL REFUND upon return of the original. ______________________________________ FRAMING IDEAS FOR PRINTS ON PHOTO PAPER ‚ñ∫ Frames for 8X10 prints, with and without mats, are widely available at stores such as Ikea, Target, Walmart, and Amazon. ‚ñ∫ If you really want to choose from a huge selection of frames and mats, go to pictureframes.com.",

The first being to become a successful clothing company. Define success; Be the number one clothing and apparel company in West Virginia. The second being an extremely large philanthropy company. What we mean by this is that with every article of clothing sold a percentage of the proceeds will go to helping families in need. Ranging from a family that needs help with medical bills , houses burnt down, food, anything that Candor Society can do to help others it will be doing. This has a lot to do with the name of the company. We wish to build CS clothing as a state wide brand, eventually a nation wide brand, or a society of people who are truthful, honest and caring people. Why buy our clothes, because they‚Äôre not just high quality threads, they‚Äôre giving people something to believe in, giving people something to be a part of.

description: "At the end of each season, barrels of our maple syrup are hand selected and set aside. These barrels, filled with our Rich Amber maple syrup, are then transferred into american oak barrels that have been previously used in the bourbon aging process. Over the course of time, the flavors that have been tucked away to rest in the wood are released into the syrup giving off hints of caramel, vanilla, oak and most importantly bourbon!!! This unique style of maple syrup compliments and pairs well with pancakes, french toast, coffee, ribs, chicken wings, salmon and much more. Visit our website for other recipes.",

description: "Andalusite with its earthly beauty wears well with Pantonne Top Colors this season. The faceted brios with color varying in degrees from red/brown to green. Adding more brilliance is faceted Whiskey Quartz with its clear, bright pale to medium brown. A nice pairing to enhance blues, greys, browns, any shade. I added 5 to 8mm top drilled fresh water chocolate pearls between faceted squares rectanges highlighted with sterling silver 2mm square beads and ending with a 2&quot; extender SS rolo chain hook closure. These semi precious gemstone encourage listening to the guidance of the inner self, also. stimulate memory and recollection. But what puts it at &quot;the top of the list&quot;, besides their brillance and eye catching splendor, they encourage moderation in all things (including moderation). Don&#39;t you just crave that?

policy_welcome: "Welcome to Amelia Bedelia Vintage! I hope you find something to brighten up your day.... I try to curate my shop with bright and colorful pieces that I would wear, or keep in my own home! Keep in mind that all vintage items will show gentle signs of wear for their age. Much better to decorate your home or stock your wardrobe with gorgeous pieces that are already out there, instead of contributing to the mass production of more STUFF! I have some hoarding tendencies, so I&#39;m always trying to find ways to use things I already have, or utilize older pieces that still have lots of life left in them. Have fun browsin&#39; around and shoot me a convo to say hi if you like! xoxo Delia Amelia Bedelia Vintage & Happy Forest Vintage",
