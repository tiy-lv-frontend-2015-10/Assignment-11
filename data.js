These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel","last_updated_tsz":1445550136,"listing_active_count":162,"login_name":"RDMULLET","accepts_custom_requests":false,"policy_welcome":"Thank you for visiting Studio B Label Co!  Want something you don&#39;t see in the shop?  Just message me with your requests!","policy_payment":null,"policy_shipping":"Standard orders in the US ship in 2 business days and are typically 3-5 business days once shipped (or 5-7 business days to your door from the time of placing your order.) \r\n\r\nI also offer 3 expedited services you can choose at check out. \r\n\r\n1)  PRIORITY SHIPPING $3.50 upgrade-  Typically 4-6 business days to your door.\r\n2)  RUSH $12.00 upgrade - Ships next business day PRIORITY  Typically 3-4 business days to your door from placing order.  Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door)\r\nPRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!","policy_refunds":"Due to the custom nature of the product, we cannot offer refunds, returns or exchanges once the design process has begun. However, I believe in happy customers so please discuss any issues you have with your order and I will do everything possible to ensure I&#39;ve exceeded your expectations!","policy_additional":"It is important to include all requested info needed to complete your order.

Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;","policy_seller_info":null,"policy_updated_tsz":1445269225,"vacation_autoreply":"Merry Christmas!

Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.

We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach.

The barrels come to us from Cactoctin Creek Distilling Company in northern Virginia. \n\nA whiskey barrel can be used for whiskey only once, by law. This creates a secondary market for the used ones. When we visited Catoctin Creek for a bottling workshop and tour I found myself wondering what else you could use the barrel for.\nClearly I found a use.\n\nA taste of Langdon Wood Barrel-Aged Maple Syrup starts off with the expected sweetness and maple flavor, but then that sugar flavor drops off  and the warm, dry feeling of a good rye whiskey \ncomes in.\n\nComes in  8 fl. oz  \/ 225ml clear flip-top bottles\nEach bottle ~9lb shipped weight (~4.2kg)\n\nUse it for breakfast, save it for dinner, what ever you like. In fact, if you&#39;re thinking about &quot;Brinner&quot;, you should be thinking about Langdon Wood","creation_tsz":1445549599,"ending_tsz":1456180399,"original_creation_tsz":1336081871,"last_modified_tsz":1445549599,"price":"72.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":2,"tags":["maple","syrup","rye","whiskey","breakfast","dinner","lunch","food","pancakes","maple syrup","foodies","barrel aged","gifts for foodies"],"category_path":["Plants and Edibles"],"category_path_ids":[68887346],"materials":["maple syrup","oak","rye"],"shop_section_id":11492565,"featured_rank":6,"state_tsz":1418150522,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/99036105\/six-pack-of-small-bottles-barrel-aged?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":538,"num_favorers":24,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2015","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":["Modern"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":956,"taxonomy_path":["Home & Living","Food & Drink","Condiments & Sauces"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":334068045,"hex_code":"8E643B","red":142,"green":100,"blue":59,"hue":29,"saturation":58,"brightness":55,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1336081871,"listing_id":99036105,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_75x75.334068045.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_170x135.334068045.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_570xN.334068045.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_fullxfull.334068045.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":997},{"listing_image_id":334200148,"hex_code":"8E6D4A","red":142,"green":109,"blue":74,"hue":30,"saturation":47,"brightness":55,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1336081871,"listing_id":99036105,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_75x75.334200148.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_170x135.334200148.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_570xN.334200148.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_fullxfull.334200148.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":273115126,"hex_code":"956A3A","red":149,"green":106,"blue":58,"hue":31,"saturation":61,"brightness":58,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1336081871,"listing_id":99036105,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_75x75.273115126.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_170x135.273115126.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_570xN.273115126.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_fullxfull.273115126.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":334200232,"hex_code":"936E49","red":147,"green":110,"blue":73,"hue":30,"saturation":50,"brightness":57,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1336081871,"listing_id":99036105,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_75x75.334200232.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_170x135.334200232.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_570xN.334200232.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_fullxfull.334200232.jpg","full_height":1500,"full_width":997},{"listing_image_id":273081921,"hex_code":"7B5E3E","red":123,"green":94,"blue":62,"hue":31,"saturation":49,"brightness":48,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1336081871,"listing_id":99036105,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_75x75.273081921.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_170x135.273081921.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_570xN.273081921.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/000\/0\/6531834\/il_fullxfull.273081921.jpg","full_height":997,"full_width":1500}],"Shop":{"shop_id":6531834,"shop_name":"LangdonWood","user_id":16733581,"creation_tsz":1316801500,"title":"Langdon Wood Barrel-Aged Maple Syrup","announcement":"Grade &#39;A&#39; Medium Maple syrup from Pennsylvania which has been aged in  used  whiskey and brandy barrels.
