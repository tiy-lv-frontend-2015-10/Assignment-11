"title": "Bourbon Whiskey Reclaimed Wood Box Crate Wall Clock -- Abstract pattern",
"description": "Beautiful, one of kind abstract Bourbon Whiskey Clock Time Piece made from an original repurposed and reclaimed wood and metal frame. Great piece to display over fireplaces, mini bars, game rooms, wine cellars, etc. This time piece captures the heart of aficionados, collectors, and bourbon lovers.  The clock is a wonderful conversation starter as it captures the essence of the Bourbon Whiskey trade.  Hand made with quality craftsmanship with wood from renowned distilleries.  All the details have been carefully considered to details enhance the time piece and provide a Bourbon Whiskey Distillery  feel and context…almost like bringing a piece of a Bourbon Whiskey Distillery right into your home.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe wood has been carefully preserved to maintain originality, context, and character. Every single piece is one of a kind. No two alike. \r\n\r\n15 1/2   Inches in Diameter -- $178.99\n25 Inches in Diameter -- $278.99\n \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nINSPIRATION:\r\n\r\nAfter a few trips to Tennessee and Kentucky, I got  a new appreciation not only for the barrels, but for the Bourbon Whiskey Culture.  To capture the essence of this culture, I found myself working with original materials including reclaimed wood pieces.  These materials tell a story much like the taste of a sip of Bourbon Whisky does.",

To capture the essence of this culture, I found myself working with original materials including reclaimed wood pieces.  These materials tell a story much like the taste of a sip of Bourbon Whisky does.",

Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",

"description": "Rocks Glass - Custom Glass Etched - Etched Glass - Custom Glass Etching - Sandblasted Glass - Personalized Beer Glasses - Whiskey Glass\n\nThe dimensions of this pint glass are as follows:\n\nHeight - 3.75 inches\nDiameter (across) - 3 inches at the top\n\nPlease specify what you would like your personalized rocks glass to contain and your font choice, either in the note section of the order, or via Etsy Conversation.\n\nAll of my glass etching is done using a professional sand carving system, not your everyday garage sandblaster.  Each item is designed, stenciled, and sand carved by me, using my artist style glass etching system.  I never etch glass using chemicals, therefore you will be able to &quot;feel&quot; the etch in your glass. The appearance of the glass etching will be a smooth, milky white, even finish.  \n\nMy Dailey Creations specializes in custom glass etching, such as unique glass vases, custom cat and dog treat jars, custom wine glasses, custom shot glasses, custom beer glasses, pilsner glasses, beer mugs and bottle openers.  If you have an idea, phrase, or story for a custom etched glass piece, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me.  It would be my pleasure to help you design your customized gift.  \n\nPersonalization is also available on any existing or new piece.  If you are in need of personalized wedding gifts, personalized groomsmen gifts, personalized bridesmaids gifts, personalized party favors, personalized glasses, or barware, send me your details, and I would be happy to work with you.  Personalized glassware is a great gift idea for any occasion.  \n\nWant a different shaped custom bar glass? Check out my other glasses here.   https://www.etsy.com/shop/MyDaileyCreations?section_id=17581133&ref=shopsection_leftnav_9\n\nWant to learn more about me and My Dailey Creations? Click here. https://www.etsy.com/shop/MyDaileyCreations/about?ref=shopinfo_about_leftnav\n\nPlease review my store policies, and ask any questions prior to purchasing. Store policies can be found here. https://www.etsy.com/shop/MyDaileyCreations/policy?ref=shopinfo_policies_leftnav\n\nShipping charges are an estimate. I charge exact shipping only to your destination. Since most of my items cannot go first class, the charges vary by location. If this charge is overstated for your location, I will promptly refund you the difference. \n\nI will consider international shipping after researching your location. Due to the fragile nature of my items, this may not always be available. Please contact me first if you are international.",

Most of my items ship within 1-3 business days.  I strive to process sooner than stated, but I like to leave some wiggle room for my family. You will be contacted if there is a delay for any unforeseen reason. If you need something by a certain date, please let me know prior to ordering and I will do my best to accommodate. Orders are processed in the order they are received. \r\n\r\nFor orders requesting samples or orders which require proofs or clarification, production time begins when I have received all required information to proceed. Should you require customization with products not normally kept in stock, production times may be slightly longer.\r\n\r\nPACKAGING\r\nRest assured, there are no hidden costs in my shipping fees. Due to the fragile nature of my items, each package will arrive with multiple types of filler and packaging.  You will never be charged for my packaging materials.   I do try to &quot;be green&quot; whenever possible, and do recycle packaging materials when I can.  \r\n\r\nSometimes glass etched items will arrived with a smudged or streaked appearance.  I assure you this is not permanent.  This happens from fingerprints and moisture.  It is easily fixed by wetting the entire etched area and drying with a cloth.  It will be back to perfect.  \r\n\r\nUSPS MAIL\r\nI ship every order within the Unites States via USPS First Class mail when available, or USPS Priority mail if the package is over one pound. You will receive an email from Etsy once your order is processed with a USPS confirmation and tracking number. I ship to the address on your Etsy account unless otherwise noted, please make sure it is correct before your purchase.  My Dailey Creations is not responsible for misdirected mail due to an incorrect address given, or address undeliverable. \r\n\r\nUSPS shipping times will vary depending upon their current workload. Please allow at least 14 days from the date of shipment for US orders before assuming your package is lost. I will be happy to work with you to achieve an amicable resolution regarding non-delivered items.\r\n\r\nShipping discounts for multiple item orders are valid only when all items are being shipped to the same address. If your items need to be shipped to multiple addresses, a separate purchase must be made for each shipping address.\r\n\r\nProduction times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\r\nDue to the fragile nature of my items, I cannot always ship international.  If you would like an international shipment, please contact me, and I would be happy to discuss the possibility.   If a package is shipped international, the buyer will be responsible for any duties, taxes or fees of any kind imposed by customs or any other authority in the destination country. Please check with your nearest customs office to inquire about any such charges. International buyers please allow up to eight weeks for your item to clear customs and be delivered to you.\r\n\r\nProduction times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.
