title: "Garden Gnome Liquor Hip Flask Stainless Steel 6 Ounce",
description: "Makes an awesome gift or a treasured keeper.

This is a brand new stainless steel liquor hip flask. It holds 6 ounces of fluid. It comes boxed. The size is 
approximately  3 3/4&quot; wide by 4 1/2&quot; high to the cap by 1&quot; thick with a curve.
Fits perfect in your pocket. All of my flasks are HAND inspected for leaks, rust, residue, dents and other imperfections. I reject 1/2 of all flasks before making them and sell them in bulk to my competitors. The process I use isn’t found anywhere else. I spent years perfecting the process.  Don’t be fooled by products made in factories. All of my items are handmade custom pieces. I also have the funnels available for purchase at no additional shipping charge if purchased with a flask.

 The image is covered in a heavy waterproof epoxy resin as seen by the shadowing 
In photo pictures. This is NOT a cheap stick on photo, this is superior
 HIGH QUALITY artwork. I use a special process that I hand make to cover the image and protect it.  
The image is a vivid color high quality graphic production. I guarantee my product.
 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed!
 If you have any questions at all please contact me. Because I make all of the flasks individually by hand it can take a few days to have them made and ready for shipment.  If you need it by a certain date please let me know and I will accommodate it if I can.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSPIRATION:

After a few trips to Tennessee and Kentucky, I got  a new appreciation not only for the barrels, but for the Bourbon Whiskey Culture.  To capture the essence of this culture, I found myself working with original materials including reclaimed wood pieces.  These materials tell a story much like the taste of a sip of Bourbon Whisky does.",

policy_welcome: "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. 

Tyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.

We finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.

Please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.

The dimensions of this pint glass are as follows:

Height - 3.75 inches
Diameter (across) - 3 inches at the top

Please specify what you would like your personalized rocks glass to contain and your font choice, either in the note section of the order, or via Etsy Conversation.

All of my glass etching is done using a professional sand carving system, not your everyday garage sandblaster.  Each item is designed, stenciled, and sand carved by me, using my artist style glass etching system.  I never etch glass using chemicals, therefore you will be able to &quot;feel&quot; the etch in your glass. The appearance of the glass etching will be a smooth, milky white, even finish.  

My Dailey Creations specializes in custom glass etching, such as unique glass vases, custom cat and dog treat jars, custom wine glasses, custom shot glasses, custom beer glasses, pilsner glasses, beer mugs and bottle openers.  If you have an idea, phrase, or story for a custom etched glass piece, don&#39;t hesitate to contact me.  It would be my pleasure to help you design your customized gift.  

Personalization is also available on any existing or new piece.  If you are in need of personalized wedding gifts, personalized groomsmen gifts, personalized bridesmaids gifts, personalized party favors, personalized glasses, or barware, send me your details, and I would be happy to work with you.  Personalized glassware is a great gift idea for any occasion.  

Want a different shaped custom bar glass? Check out my other glasses here.   https://www.etsy.com/shop/MyDaileyCreations?section_id=17581133&ref=shopsection_leftnav_9

Shipping charges are an estimate. I charge exact shipping only to your destination. Since most of my items cannot go first class, the charges vary by location. If this charge is overstated for your location, I will promptly refund you the difference. 

I will consider international shipping after researching your location. Due to the fragile nature of my items, this may not always be available. Please contact me first if you are international.",

If you would like it to be delivered elsewhere, please let me know upon check out. Tax is automatically applied to Georgia residents only. Per Etsy guidelines, coupon codes cannot be combined.",
policy_shipping: "*******PLEASE NOTE********** Shipping charges are an estimate.  I charge exact shipping only to your destination.  Since most of my items cannot go first class, the charges vary by location.  If this charge is overstated for your location, I will promptly refund you the difference.  

If you are international, unfortunately I have no way of know how much, or if you will be charged custom fee&#39;s, or duty taxes.  Therefore, I am not responsible for any charges additional to the actual shipment charges incurred by the United States Post Office.  

TURN AROUND TIME
Instant gratification is always my goal.  For an accurate turn around time, please check the shipping tab on the listing. Those will be updated with current timing, as timing will vary based on stocked items vs. custom items.  Most of my items ship within 1-3 business days.  I strive to process sooner than stated, but I like to leave some wiggle room for my family. You will be contacted if there is a delay for any unforeseen reason. If you need something by a certain date, please let me know prior to ordering and I will do my best to accommodate. Orders are processed in the order they are received. 

For orders requesting samples or orders which require proofs or clarification, production time begins when I have received all required information to proceed. Should you require customization with products not normally kept in stock, production times may be slightly longer.

PACKAGING
Rest assured, there are no hidden costs in my shipping fees. Due to the fragile nature of my items, each package will arrive with multiple types of filler and packaging.  You will never be charged for my packaging materials.   I do try to &quot;be green&quot; whenever possible, and do recycle packaging materials when I can.  

Sometimes glass etched items will arrived with a smudged or streaked appearance.  I assure you this is not permanent.  This happens from fingerprints and moisture.  It is easily fixed by wetting the entire etched area and drying with a cloth.  It will be back to perfect.  

USPS MAIL
I ship every order within the Unites States via USPS First Class mail when available, or USPS Priority mail if the package is over one pound. You will receive an email from Etsy once your order is processed with a USPS confirmation and tracking number. I ship to the address on your Etsy account unless otherwise noted, please make sure it is correct before your purchase.  My Dailey Creations is not responsible for misdirected mail due to an incorrect address given, or address undeliverable. 

USPS shipping times will vary depending upon their current workload. Please allow at least 14 days from the date of shipment for US orders before assuming your package is lost. I will be happy to work with you to achieve an amicable resolution regarding non-delivered items.

Shipping discounts for multiple item orders are valid only when all items are being shipped to the same address. If your items need to be shipped to multiple addresses, a separate purchase must be made for each shipping address.

Production times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.

INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
Due to the fragile nature of my items, I cannot always ship international.  If you would like an international shipment, please contact me, and I would be happy to discuss the possibility.   If a package is shipped international, the buyer will be responsible for any duties, taxes or fees of any kind imposed by customs or any other authority in the destination country. Please check with your nearest customs office to inquire about any such charges. International buyers please allow up to eight weeks for your item to clear customs and be delivered to you.

Production times will vary so please check the listing for current production times to make sure that your order will arrive within your required time frame.  ",

It is the Urdu word that means &quot;Unique or Unusual&quot; which I think describes many of my pieces and overall asthetic. Jewelry is one of the great ways for each of us to express our individuality and add flair, depending on how we feel that day or what we want to present to the world.

Each piece is handmade by me, in a smoke free environment using semiprecious gemstones and a variety of metals. Most pieces are one of a kind, but I may be able to duplicate a past piece that has sold or is reserved.

Please let me know if you have any questions or requests.  I would be happy to add on or adjust something I have posted to your size requirements. I am also able to fill custom orders.

policy_welcome: "Welcome to my hand crafted jewelry shop!  Most designs may be modified, personalized or enhanced with additional jewels upon request.  Contact me to have a design replicated in a different birthstone or colorway.  I welcome custom orders!  I will gladly combine shipping and I do accept returns (see terms below).  

All designs are guaranteed free of defects in materials or workmanship for a period of one year (Exceptions: pearls are porous and can disintegrate/opals are brittle and can crack if abused).  Within 14 days of purchase however even my pearl and opal designs may be returned for free repair!

All items bear a free lifetime service ticket.  Simply return all parts for servicing.  Missing or damaged parts may incur a small materials charge.  Re-stringing may incur labor charges.

Please take a moment to glance through these policies and feel free to contact me if you have questions.",
policy_payment: "I accept PayPal, but you do not need a PayPal account to buy from me using a credit card. My PayPal account is configured to also bypass PayPal if you so choose. 

Cheques: I will accept CAD cheques written on Canadian banks. Use www.xe.com to estimate CAD equivalent and convo to arrange sending a CAD cheque.

Money Orders: I accept Canadian postal money orders for the CAD equivalent of the prices which are shown here in USD.
International Postal Money Orders (in USD) are also okay.
Please convo to arrange alternate payments like these. 

Lay Away: is *always* available for any of my listings. Take up to three months or 90 days to complete the purchase.  Convo to arrange the desired number of instalment payments.  Down payments made on layaway terms are non refundable.

Please pay immediately upon checkout. I require payment within three days of purchase unless you are forwarding a cheque/money order or have arranged layaway. In these cases shipping takes place once full payment is received.",
policy_shipping: "IF YOU ARE NEW TO PAYPAL, OR ARE NEW TO ONLINE BUYING OR IF YOU ARE NEW TO ETSY:  Ensure that your paypal profile is accurate and complete -- ensure that you&#39;ve keyed in your full shipping address (within PayPal). If you buy expensive items like jewelry give serious thought to adding a contact telephone number to your paypal profile so those contact details will appear on paypal generated ship labels. Like many wise online shippers, by default I use paypal`s ship module and I must ship to your stated paypal address (see below about adding alternate addresses to your paypal profile). 

If your item goes missing we, like many online merchants, cannot be held responsible for items lost in the post.

Note: I charge a $25 fee for items returned non-deliverable, including items returned due to inaccurate/partial address or for a refused shipment. International recipients are responsible for customs, duties or domestic handling fees assessed by their postal authority. Refused shipments are charged a $25 restocking fee. 

All jewelry items in this shop arrive gift wrapped inside a new attractive gift box made of quality material, often with tissue paper filler and always a tied ribbon bow. 

Small value items ($50 value or less) may be shipped via Air Mail service (not insured, expedited or tracked).  Convo if you&#39;re not sure which ship method will apply.   

Our packages are clearly addressed and we maintain records as proof of all shipments. 
All shipments outside Canada are processed using PayPal Ship module.  Shipping takes place promptly per the time frame specified for each item.

If your paypal address is &quot;unconfirmed&quot; or your PayPal sender status is &quot;unverified&quot;... I usually don&#39;t ship until I receive your written confirmation that you have authorized the paypal transaction.  I will email for confirmation -- shipment takes place once you&#39;ve replied/confirmed that you duly made the purchase.

If your purchase is time sensitive please convo I will strive for same day/next day dispatch. 

Please convo to discuss and arrange payment for expedited shipping (it is included on many Canada/USA shipments).  I don`t offer overnight service.

All purchase transactions receive a followup notifier email confirming that fulfillment is taking place and advising approximate delivery time.

We use the PayPal Shipping module so ensure that your paypal address info is current and up to date as we ship to your paypal address by default.  

If you require shipment to an address other than that specified within your paypal profile please add the alternate address(es) to your paypal profile before purchasing!   Paypal&#39;s seller protection policy limits me and states that I must ship to the address that appears on your transaction.  Please don&#39;t ask me to re-direct your packages.  Buyers can add alternate ship addresses to their own paypal profile. 

Canada Post does not provide Saturday or weekend/holiday mail service and Canada Post outlets offer only ONE pickup daily (approximately 5pm eastern). 

To Canada:
=========
We usually dispatch via insured and tracked service.   

To USA: 
======
Many items in this shop are dispatched via Canada Post&#39;s Tracked Packet or Expedited service which is trackable.  Expect delivery in 7 business days or less for Expedited and 4-15 days for Tracked.  Follow Etsy`s review guidelines and allow 11 days for a cross border shipment though!

If you&#39;re not sure whether the shipment will be insured please convo me. 

International/Worldwide:
======================= 
Prices are specified on a per item basis and the service is Canada Post&#39;s regular Air Mail (no tracking or insurance).

For large packets/high value orders we use insurable and tracked courier (arrives 4-7 business days). Costs vary widely depending upon destination.  Actual cost is $50-75.  Contact us regarding your international shipping concerns or with any shipping questions.
",
policy_refunds: "I charge a $25 fee for packages returned undeliverable, including items returned due to inaccurate/partial address or for a refused shipment. International recipients are responsible for customs, duties or domestic handling fees assessed by their postal authority. Refused shipments are charged a $25 restocking fee. 

Made to Order and Custom Request items are not returnable.

Shipping fees are not refunded under any circumstances.

Within 14 days of receipt many items (in their original state) may be returned for exchange, refund or shop credit. A minimum 25% restocking fee may apply. Please convo me to arrange a return. Again, shipping fees are non refundable. 

For approved returns please note:
Do not write Return To Sender on the original ship label (doing so means it can take one to six months for the package to get back to me). 

I will process your refund (same day) when the item arrives here. 

Returning a purchase voids any vouchers/discount coupon(s) issued. 

When returning merchandise kindly return any Gift With Purchase bonus(es). 

NOTE:
With a few exceptions, bridal jewelry (pearl designs) generally do not qualify for return. If you&#39;re not sure whether an item is returnable please convo me prior to purchasing.",
policy_additional: "I will always consider modifying a design to suit your needs.  Most items shown here can be lengthened or shortened for free prior to shipping.  Convo me with the details for a prompt firm quote.

We carry hundreds of gemstone beads and I have a vast array of precious metal findings so if you&#39;d like me to create a custom version of one of these designs, kindly convo your interest.

We have hundreds of other items available for sale. Please convo if you are looking for something not currently shown here.  

Loose Gemstone bead stock is available for sale at GahooleTreeSupplies or http://www.gahooletreesupplies.etsy.com and our newest shop AbbeyForge offers popular priced jewelry ideas all handmade by me using top quality materials: http://www.AbbeyForge.etsy.com.",

FREE SHIPPING 48 CONT. STATES

We only ship to the lower 48 U.S. states.

&quot;BUT&quot;

To accommodate our &quot;would be&quot; Canadian Customers

Kinek Border Shipping for Canadians

We have partnered with (www.Kinek.com) to provide a great new shipping option to our Canadian customers. Kinek has set up secure parcel receiving locations, called Kinek Points, at nearly every major border crossing between the US and Canada. Each location is located on the US side of the border and by signing up for the Kinek service and shipping to one of them, you can receive the same shipping prices as US customers. Once your package arrives, Kinek notifies you (by email, text message, or push notification) and will then store the package for up to 30 days for you. You can then drive to the Kinek Point and pick up the item at a convenient time for you. Upon pick-up, you pay a small fee, usually $5 for packages under 30lbs, far less than international shipping and brokerage fees! Some of the major cities Kinek serves are: Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa, Winnipeg, London, Kingston, Kelowna, Sault Ste. Marie, Saint John, Fredericton, Calgary and Cornwall.

description: "NOTE: THIS IS A PATTERN, not a finished product

&quot;Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.&quot;

Whole-ass your Swanson/Parks and Rec love by creating your own little piece of Pawnee with this digital cross stitch pattern. Ron&#39;s hair, stache, and quote are surrounded by objects inspired by the Ron Swanson Pyramid of Greatness.

With your purchase you will receive a PDF with an image of the finished product, a full chart, and recommended DMC colors in the key.

Design area is 6.2 x 7.5 inches.

Due to the size of the project, some half stitches, and back stitching, this project is better for intermediate stitchers or ambitious beginners.

We will file a shipping claim on your behalf and work to get you a replacement as soon as possible.

Work or replacement items cannot begin until we have required photographs.

OAK BARREL INFO:

There are lots of oak barrel makers out there (with lots of different theories and practices) and there is lots of info on the Web. We suggest learning more if you have specific questions. Here are some helpful tips we found online (this is just a general summary of information and not meant to be complete):

• As the barrels are a wood product, they are subject to the wood drying and shrinking.
• In order for the spigot to flow freely, please remember to remove the bung/cork before you open the spigot ... pour from the spigot ... then close the spigot and finally ... replace the bung/cork. 
• To keep your barrels performing and looking their best, please keep them stored in a protected area away from the elements and optimally in a cool and relatively humid area. 
• Barrels with painted black steel hoops are particularly susceptible to moisture. A little care goes a long way. Prevent excessive staining and rust by keeping the exterior of the barrel dry.
• Avoid water stains by using a funnel to carefully fill your new barrel. 
• Sandpaper will generally remove any stains or marks on the barrel. 
• As the barrels are handcrafted, liquid volume is approximate. 
• You should be able to reuse your barrel from 3-5 times ... remember that each aging will take longer than the previous one. 
• Please do not nail or put screws into the hoops or staves as doing so will compromise the oak and might cause damage. 
• If you want to age a different type of spirit then was initially aged in it, we recommend you use a new barrel. 
• For your safety, if using chemicals to clean/sanitize your barrels, please follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper use.
• The spirit can age anywhere from one week to one-year, but it&#39;s recommended that you take a small taste test every two weeks.  Remember to only take a small taste to ensure the top of the barrel does not get dry to avoid leaking and losing your spirit to the &#39;Angel&#39;s Share.&#39;  Once the spirit reaches your perfect taste, empty the spirit into a decanter and restart the process!

Angel’s Share.
Angel’s Share is a fancy name for evaporation. Since mini-barrel staves are thinner than normal distillery size 53-gallon barrel staves, there is a higher “angel’s share”, thus higher evaporation. To avoid this evaporation, make sure you follow the instructions and 1) fill the barrel to the very top when first filling the barrel with your spirit; and 2) keep the top of the barrel moist after using the barrel by rolling the liquid around every couple of days. As previously mentioned, we recommend taking very small taste-tests every two weeks to ensure much of the top of the barrel does not become dry.&quot;

Storing your Empty Barrel After Initial Use 
Ideally, your barrel would always be filled. Used barrels require no special preparation beyond a simple water rinse, if desired, when transferring out and in immediately. If used barrels are to be stored empty, rinse them several times with clean water, and drain thoroughly. Remove the spigot and bung to promote air flow and store out of sunlight and in a cool (55° – 60°) and optimally humid (65% - 75%) area. 

An alternative is to fill and store barrels with a sulfur-citric holding solution (recipes are online). This holding solution promotes sanitation and keeps the barrels swelled and smelling sweet however ... it will strip some of the oaks flavors. For your safety and the safety of your family, always follow manufacturers’ guidelines and instructions for the proper use of chemicals.
