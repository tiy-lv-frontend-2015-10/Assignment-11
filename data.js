"description": "Floral flask with wood print background.  \n\n...............................................................................................................................\n\nTHE DETAILS:\n\nBrand new stainless steel flask with screw top. \nSize:  6oz\nWaterproof sublimation design wraps all the way around the flask.\n\nGift options:\nYou can choose to have the flask only, or include a flask funnel for easy filling.\n\n...............................................................................................................................\n\nCUSTOM ORDER NAMES AND INITIALS: \n\nIf the flask you choose has a personalized name or initial/s, please write them in the notebox at checkout EXACTLY as you want them to be printed. Refunds/exchanges are not offered for customer mistakes in spelling. **Proofs are not sent for regular orders**\n\n**Failure to supply the correct information at checkout can result in delays for your order**\n\n..............................................................................................................................\n\nHOW WE DO IT:\n\nAll our flasks are made with a special high quality polymer wrap using permanent Dye Sublimation.  Our wraps are durable, waterproof, and have a scratch resistant gloss finish.  The design wraps all the way around the flask, slightly overlapping in the back. \n\nDye Sublimation, is the method of applying an image/graphic to specially coated ceramics, metals, polyester cloth, and polymers, using specialty sublimation inks,  sublimation printers, high heat, and pressure.  Sublimation ink is unique because it is converted from a solid to a gas without becoming a liquid. The conversion is initiated by heat and high pressure. The end result is a beautiful and durable work of art that will never fade.\n\n...............................................................................................................................\n\nSHIPPING:\n\nEvery flask is made to order, so please allow for up to 1-10 business days (Mon-Fri) before your order is shipped. \n\nU.S. Orders will ship USPS first class with tracking. The usual time frame for this is 3-5 business days.\n\nINTERNATIONAL orders will ship USPS First Class International.  Delivery varies from 10 days to 6 weeks depending on customs and location.\n*Please be aware there may be customs fees due when your package is delivered.  These fees are the customers responsibility, please know the rules for customs fees in your specific country.*  \n\n................................................................................................................................\n\nNeed a large quantity for Wedding Parties, Businesses, or other special events? No problem, just send me a convo, and we can create a custom order just for you.\n\n**Please keep in mind that every flask is handmade to order by me. I strive to make them as close to the actual listing as possible, but there may be slight variations from the photos shown. Also please allow for small variations in color due to the variances in monitor settings.**\n\nThanks for stopping by!",

It measures 2” inches in diameter and 2 ¼” inches high.\n\nIn excellent condition.\n\nA shot glass’ normal size is 1.5 oz.  &quot;Short shot&quot; glasses or &quot;pony shots&quot; are 1 ounce.\nIn bartending, a &quot;shot glass&quot; is usually 1.5 ounces, but sometimes 2 ounces with a measuring line at 1.5 ounces. You can also buy (in US) &quot;short shot&quot; glasses or &quot;pony shots&quot; which are 1 ounce. Pony shots are usually used with Martinis, Manhattans, and Rob Roys.\n\nMost shot glasses are found in the United States, but shot glasses from before the 1940s are very rare.\n\nBefore Prohibition in the U.S. in the early-to-mid-1900s, thin-sided whiskey glasses were common. After Prohibition, these were replaced by shot glasses with a thick base and thick sides.\n\nShipped USPS First Class",

With that being said, if I am shipping your order outside the US please be aware that International orders can take 2-8 weeks to arrive depending on customs. International shipments will be made by USPS 1st Class Mail International Package plus 3rd party insurance. Certain sized items and possible combined shipments will be of the size where they will need to be shipped by Priority Mail International service. Estimating what certain combined shipments may be is difficult, but please know overages in shipping charges that exceed $5.00 will be refunded. \r\n\r\nAll orders shipped outside the US may have duty or tax fees that your country might charge you. These are fees that I cannot quote you for and that I will not be held responsible for. Please purchase accordingly and cautiously - be aware that you might have to pay duty or tax fees upon accepting your order. I am charging actual shipping fees ONLY! Again I will not be responsible and will not pay your duty or tax fees. International rates are figured by the ounce and rates may fluctuate slightly after the order has been packed for shipping.\r\n\r\nPlease be aware it is unlawful for me to falsify dollar amounts or mark your purchase as a &quot;gift&quot; in order to avoid duty charges, please refrain from asking me to do so. Delays in customs are beyond the control of the USPS and thingsneedahome.\r\n\r\n•\tCombined shipping rates are based on the higher of the individual rates.\r\n\r\n•\tYour package will be carefully wrapped and boxed. Allow listed business days for your order to process, but let me know if you need something quickly. I have expedited shipping options available and can usually get your package out right away.\r\n\r\n•\tOur primary carrier is the  USPS.  Also, IF YOU PROVIDE ME WITH A PO BOX, the only way I can ship to you is via USPS. A telephone number may be required on international orders.\r\n\r\n•\tTracking is included on all packages except first class international. If you would like a way to track a package internationally, you must instruct me to charge you the priority rate.

This has an elastic band at the top & a loose one at the bottom. It&#39;s super cute & looks excellent with any pair of gold heels.. I&#39;ve won quite a few contests with it. Goes great if you want your boyfriend, friend, or baby to be a can of coke....very unique & original \n\nYours will be a brand new one.....made tomorrow & 2-3 day priority shipping. I plan on making one last batch of these tomorrow, Sunday 10/24 w 2 extra ones just in case anyone else wants one.\n\nIt has no crown OR shoes...I&#39;ve wore a kid&#39;s Burger King crown & a regular purple velvet style king&#39;s crown from the store (looks like the one on the bottle)....both were fine. \n\nShipping has been adjusted for 1-3 day shipping to ensure you have it before Halloween. I can make it bigger if you need a bigger dress for an additional $15.\n\nI&#39;ll plan on making the words pop a little more...maybe attempt to trace it with glitter glue or sprinkle it over the wet gold paint....I&#39;ll try to post a new picture of it once I&#39;ve done it.",

(1st Proud Moment - 2nd grade - I was awarded second place by famous painters Jamie & Andrew Wyeth for my sponge painted fall trees.  That&#39;s when I knew I loved art!)  \r\n\r\nI was an elementary school teacher for eleven years and taught kindergarten through third grade.  Then we moved around a lot and I stayed home with kids for a while. Later I went back to school for Graphic Design.  \r\n\r\nMy oldest daughter was married in October of 2011 and I put my Graphic Design skills to good use.  I created all of the wedding items, signs, and decorations for her special day.  During the wedding I received many compliments on the handmade items.  Later, my daughter suggested I open an ETSY shop to sell similar items to busy brides/grooms who do not have the time to create them.  So this past spring, my daughter helped me set up iDo by ksoldo and now I can proudly say I own my own business!\r\n\r\nMy youngest daughters are heading to the United Kingdom to study at performing arts conservatories this fall, so I will have an &quot;empty nest&quot; for the first time in 26 years.

"title": "The Gent Beard Oil - Whiskey-inspired scent",
"description": "Scent: very warm, rich, woodsy, with a hint of citrus and smooth vanilla finish\nScent Strength: medium\nTherapeutic Essential Oil Benefits: antidepressant, eases anxiety and improves self-confidence, stimulating\n\nKey Benefits: Can help fight SAD or Seasonal Affective Disorder. Can help improve skin elasticity and moisturization, and is good for those who suffer from eczema or psoriasis.\n\nFor the man who likes to end his day with a few fingers of whiskey and a good cigar. This beard oil is for the gent&#39;s beard. It&#39;s classy, with strong notes of smoke and vanilla, and high notes of flora and citrus.\n\nThe signature scent&#39;s inspiration comes from a good strong glass of whiskey, taking notes from popular bourbons and ryes, that often have strong spice and oak notes, mixed with a smoky undertone and high citrus flavors. And thus, after much research (in which much whiskey was consumed), The Gent was born.\n\nNOTE: There is no alcohol in the beard oil. It is only scented with inspiration from the flavors of fine whiskey.\n\n---\n\nThe ingredients are all natural, with only beneficial properties. There are no fragrances; only natural essential oils. This helps prevent skin irritation.\n\nThis beard oil works hard on your beard and your face. What you put on your beard ultimately works its way to your skin, which is exactly what this oil is meant to do. The base of the beard oil also has carefully-chosen carrier oils, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, and argan oil, that are known for helping encourage healthy appearance, while moisturizing both the beard and the skin underneath.\n\nThe oil can help new beard-growers deal with that itchy stage, while it&#39;ll help keep the beard soft and handsome as it grows and is maintained, as well.\n\n100% all natural ingredients. Non-comedogenic. Gluten free. Non-toxic. Fragrance free.\n\nComes in a 1oz amber glass bottle with a dropper for easy application, or 1/4 oz vial for sampling.\n\nA little about essential oils and the beard oils’ scents:\nIf scents and fragrances often give you headaches, you have nothing to worry about here! What causes migraines are fragrance oils, which are usually filled with chemicals that are oftentimes neurotoxins. My scents are 100% natural, created from combinations of therapeutic essential oils, which often can help with headaches, rather than cause them.",

A lot of love goes into the handcrafting of each order, and that doesn’t happen immediately. Thanks for your patience!\r\nGeneral Shipping Policies\r\n\r\nShipping is determined on a product by product basis. Most items are processed and shipped within 1-10 business  days of an order from Seattle, Washington. Larger orders that are boxes/kits or contain 3 or more items will typically take 3-14 business days to ship. Some orders will take longer because of the nature of the item purchased. \r\n\r\nProcessing time is separate from shipping time. Processing time is how long it takes to make and label and pack your order, and shipping time is the time in which your order will be in transit to you. \r\n\r\nWe try to provide tracking information for all packages. If you have a concern or question about an item that you purchased and are awaiting its arrival, let us know.\r\nWe are not responsible for any duties collected on international orders. We have no control of customs holds the package and delays or prevents delivery.\r\n\r\nPlease be certain all shipping information is correct BEFORE clicking ”Confirm Payment.” Whiskey, Ink, & Lace is not responsible for packages lost due to incorrect shipping information.\r\n\r\nOther Shipping\r\n\r\nWe do not currently have a retail space in Seattle, but we do offer will call! Our will call hours are by appointment only between 9a-3p M-F. Please contact us in advance to set up a will call order.\r\n\r\nInternational customers: please let us know if you have any problems with shipping options at checkout. We will help you as quickly as possible to remedy the problem.\r\nInternational orders may take longer to arrive. Customs may delay delivery which is beyond our control.\r\n\r\nBuyer is responsible for any imposed duties on order.\r\n\r\nPlease check the USPS website for their schedule of Holiday Dates For Domestic Mail. Their deadline for first class mail is December 20th. However, there’s no guarantee that orders made on December 18th or 19th will be dropped off at the post office by December 20th. Get at us with any questions!\r\n\r\n\r\nTaxes\r\n\r\nNothing is sure, but death and taxes, eh? If you reside in Washington state like us, you’ll be charged a tax rate based on your location within the state at checkout. Otherwise, you’re off the hook!",
"policy_refunds": "Returns Policy\r\n\r\nYou may return new items items within 14 days of delivery for a full refund. If the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect item), we will pay for the return shipping.\r\n\r\nYou should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of receiving refund authorization from us, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days) if you return the item, the time it takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10 business days).\r\n\r\nWe cannot offer exchanges just because it makes it easy to create errors in our system. We can, however, provide you with store credit if you&#39;re interested.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE\r\n\r\nRefunds and credits for returned merchandise will be issued only for unused products returned in its original packaging if a return is authorized. If used, it contaminates the raw product and we are unable to use it appropriately. We do not accept returns for &quot;clearance&quot; items, samples, clothing, or mugs. We are unable to accept returns for international orders.\r\n\r\nAll shipping charges become the sole responsibility of the customer, unless it is the error of Whiskey, Ink, & Lace. All returns must be postmarked within 30 days of the invoice date to qualify for a return. Refused or non-deliverable packages will be canceled upon receipt and will be subject to a return shipping fee by the carrier.\r\n\r\nPlease do not return products that do not meet the return criteria listed above, as we will not be able to issue refunds for non-qualifying items and cannot return the items to you.

Also please note that any buyers are responsible for any Customs Fees, taxes, tariffs, or other duties incurred.\r\nTracking is always included!\r\nPlease note that some countries will hold packages coming in from out of their country.

"policy_additional": "I accept custom orders!  Do you have a design in mind? Give me a shout!\r\n\r\nAll artwork, reproductions, and images on https://www.etsy.com/shop/KustomProducts are copyrighted (c) by Kathleen Cheever. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nCommon Questions:\r\n\r\n1. How long until I get my products?\r\n\r\nProcessing time for all items is 1-2 weeks. Please remember that each item is customized to your specifications and therefore take a little time to create.\r\n\r\n2. I need my items quicker then the processing time offered is this possible?\r\n\r\nYes! Rush processing is available however there will be an extra fee involved. Rush processing fee is based on the number of items, weight of items, where the items will be shipped to, and how quickly those items are needed. All rush processes are &quot;after hours.&quot; No item will reserve priority over another and all items all processed in the order that they are received. If you need an order rushed, the order will be fulfilled after hours so to not effect the order of the other items. Please note that part of the rush processing fee is the cost of an employee working after hours.\r\n\r\n3. What are the extra fees and why are there extra fees?\r\n\r\nThe extra fees will very by item. Some of the extra fees could be:\r\n-Priority Shipping-based on the amount and weight of the item along with where the items need to be shipped to.\r\n-Rush Processing-Please understand that EVERYONE needs/wants their items as quickly as possible and one customer&#39;s item will for NO reason be placed in priority over another customers item. Because of this all rush processing orders are filled after hours or on weekends and will occur and rush processing fee. All rush processing fees will be in the range of $10-$100 depending on the size of the project and how quickly the items are needed.\r\n\r\n4. What mail carrier do you use and how long will it take to receive my items once they are shipped.\r\n\r\nAt the current time my main provider is USPS with very few packages being shipped out FedEx. USPS website states the following for shipping in the 48 USA:\r\nAll items under 13 oz 2-5 days\r\nAll other items 2-9 days\r\nPriority items 2-3 days\r\nUSPS Shipping outside the USA:\r\nFirst Class Mail 5-16 Business Days\r\nPriority Mail 6-10 Business Days\r\nExpress Mail 3-5 Business Days\r\n\r\n**ALL customs can stop and hold packages for any amount of time and is not covered by shipping times\r\n\r\n5. I am a foreign buyer, what fee will be associated with my package? \r\n\r\nAll countries have their own fee associated with packages being mailed in from a foreign buyer.  Please contact the appropriate government agency to find out what your fees will be.  All packages will be marked as goods sold without exception.  All fees relating to the package within the buyers country will be the responsibility of the buyer.\r\n\r\n6. Do you accept returns?\r\n\r\nNo returns will be accepted on any personalized items.  Do to the customization of the items they can not be resold to another customer and therefore all sales on these items are finial.\r\n\r\n7. Do you accept cancellations on your items?\r\n\r\nCancellations on items will be accepted within a 24 hour time period as long as the item has not been currently worked on or in production. Currently worked on or in production items also includes any custom items that included mock ups/proofs. Due to the time constants of mock ups/proofs these items are considered &quot;in production&quot; and cannot be canceled once started. All items that have not been started but are passed the 24 hour time limit will be given as credit of funds towards the shop for a future purchase within 265 day from original purchase date.\r\n \r\n8. Do you do proofs/mock ups/pictures of your items?\r\n\r\nDue to work load I do not do proofs/mock ups/pictures of items at no cost, doing so would add a 2-4 day extra processing time for all items. The reason is every day I get 25-50 requests for such items, the average mock up/picture takes 5-20 minutes a piece resulting in 2-17 hours a day. If you would like a proof/mock up/picture of your item an extra $5 charge will be added onto your item cost per proof needed.\r\n\r\n9. For custom Images:\r\n\r\nAll images need to be in a vector style format as well as black and white.  A vector image is made up of paths not of pixels which results in clean lines that the laser can read. Any none vector image (.jpg for example) shows pixels which the laser will pick up and engrave onto your objects resulting in an image that will look blurry. The acceptable vector formats are: .ai, .cdr, .eps. Please note that most .png images will not be acceptable. \r\nIf you have an image that is not a vector format such as a .jpg  that you would like to use I can either have a graphic artist trace it out for you at a cost of $25-$50 or you can go to a site such as www.vectormagic.com  where you can sign up for free and get multiple conversions into a vector image. If you go this route I would need the .eps file that you download from the site.\r\nThe cost of a custom item after the black and white vector is received varies on the size of the image and the item the image is to be engraved on. Cost range from $2.50 per item to $40 for large items. If you are looking for multiple items for a company or another occasion discounts for large quantity orders will be given.\r\nAll vector images need to be sent to Kate@KustomProductsInc.com because Etsy does not currently support vector style uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. Why are the silver flasks more expensive then the other flasks?\r\n\r\nThe silver flasks cost more then the other flasks due to production costs. In order to produce the mark on a silver flask a marking agent must be used. The marking agent is a very expensive spray that reacts with the heat of the laser.  After the marking agent is placed the item that is being marked the item must be marked at a high heat and at a very low speed that takes 4 times longer then other similar items.\r\n\r\n11. LAYAWAY: I know that wedding budgeting can be tricky and sometime it is just easier to pay a few payments then one lump sum. For that reason layaway will now be available on purchases of $250 or more.  Please read the following rules carefully:\r\n-Layaway is for purchases of $250 or more. If you would like layaway on a purchase less then this please contact me and I will see if something can be arranged.\r\n-A 10% layaway fee will be added to the cost of your order. For a $250 order this would be $25.\r\n-Layaway payments can be made by credit card via Etsy and/or PayPal. No checks or money orders will be accepted.\r\n-There will be no refunds of money for any lawaway purchases. All money that is currently paid to the shop can be used as shop credit only minus the layaway fee.\r\n-1/3 is due on purchase, 1/3 in 30 days, and the balance in 60 days\r\n",

"description": "The New Yorker debuted on February 21, 1925.  The non-fiction feature articles (which usually make up the bulk of the magazine&#39;s content) cover an eclectic array of topics. The magazine is notable for its editorial traditions and famous cover art. Enjoy the crisp cover. Remove the cover and frame it, or read and enjoy the entire magazine over and over again. Complete your collection perhaps? \n\nThis July 10, 1989 features the article, “The City Gone Psycho”, by Pauline Kael.” Cover art is by Jenni Oliver. \n\nThis magazine is in its original shipping plastic. There is no shipping label on the document or the packaging. It has not been opened or internally examined. It may not be in perfect condition since it has traveled through the mail. Additionally it is a quarter century old and the paper may have degraded minimally. It does however appear to be in exceptional collectible condition unless otherwise noted. \n\nA note about shipping: I try to save you costs by shipping the most inexpensive way possible. This magazine will ship in a brown business envelope with no extra packaging. If you want it shipped with extra packaging or in a different manner, please start a conversation with me, and I will be happy to try and coordinate it with you.",

"title": "Whiskey Cream Organic Lollipops Liquor All Natural Gourmet Gifts Favors Party Ideas",
"description": "We experimented with batch after batch of whiskey cream pops in order to achieve the perfect balance between whiskey, sugar, vanilla and cream in order to bring you these unusual, highly addictive pops.   Creamy and sweet with smokey whiskey undertones but without that stinging bite — 99% of the alcohol burns off leaving nothing but flavor and goodness behind.  in taste tests, even some of whiskey&#39;s most ardent naysayers have fallen in love them. Amen, sistah! \n\n*5 standard sized pops per package.\n\n*Ingredients: Organic vegan sugar, organic non-GMO corn syrup, organic whole cream, Jim Beam whiskey, whiskey extract, organic Madagascar vanilla extract.\n\n\nOur Eco-Freindly Promise:\n\nAll pops are made in responsible ceramic ‘green pans.’  Green pans are lead, cadmium, Teflon, and PFOA free.  We do not use aluminum and work on unbleached, chlorine free FSC certified parchment papers.\n\nOur shipping materials consist of recycled biodegradable cardboard, recycled paper shreds, and unbleached, petroleum and chlorine free recyclable snack bags made from 100% renewable resources. Our waxed bags (when we use them) are soy free, unbleached, and made from natural Parrafin wax; they are landfill safe and will not degrade and contaminate groundwater.  Our lollipop wrappers are from Nature Flex™ and are Cello bags made from wood cellulose fibers sourced with sustainable forestry principles. They are certified biodegradable, compostable and made carbon zero. Meets ASTM D6400, EN13432 standards for CA and other states. Finally, our ribbons are made from cotton yarn that is grown and dyed responsibly in the USA. Ribbon is acid and lignin free. Soy based inks are used when ribbon is printed. Ribbon is also compliant with California Proposition 65. \n\nPops vary in color from light amber to a rich brown, depending on the ingredients.  This is a GOOD thing.  We never use artificial colorants, which means what you see is what you get.  All sugar caramelizes to some degree when heated, imparting a nice toasty color.  There are a few all-natural colorants (very few), but generally, if your pop is colored, white, almost white, or crystal clear it usually means bleached sugar or additives were used in the process.  Colored pops are pretty, but we have no problem sacrificing looks for kick-ass, unbeatable flavors and taste.  I mean, you’re eating them, right, not wearing them on your neck (besides, our pops are pretty nice to look at anyway).\n\nIn that vein, we sometime pour our pops freestyle and sometimes use molds, though we prefer pouring freestyle.  Hand poured freestyle pops can be very organic looking and sculptural (which we love).  Molded pops are perfectly round — generally they are all the same size and weight.  There really is no rhyme or reason to which we choose though, so if YOU have a preference, please let us know and we&#39;ll happily oblige.",

That said, we&#39;ve shipped all over the world and have never had a problem with lost or delayed packages with the exception of one package to Istanbul, which was returned to us from Turkey for reasons unknown.  In other words, generally speaking, you can feel pretty confident that you will receive your order.

Taste is subjective and we make every effort to try to accurately describe each flavor in our listings, so we DO NOT issue refunds if you don&#39;t like the flavor of your lollipop (though we might be willing to send you free samples of a different flavor).  Likewise, we also do our very best to safely package your pops.  Therefore, customers shoulder the responsibility for broken pops.  That said, if you do receive a package in overall poor condition, please convo us and we&#39;ll do our best to work something out — we don&#39;t expect you to make do with an entire package of little broken pieces!  For any other reason, please convo us and we&#39;ll do our best to find a solution the suits everyone.  ",
"policy_additional": "Candy Shelf Life —\r\n\r\nLollipops: For the most part, all of our lollipops are made from organic, natural and locally sourced products. We DO NOT use preservatives other than those that occur naturally.  For this reason all lollipops have about a 2-3 month shelf life during dry seasons and in drier climates and a 1-2 month shelf life during humid seasons and in humid climates if kept indoors in a cool environment.  As rule of thumb, the more moisture in the air, the faster exposed candy goes goopy and/or loses its flavor.  HOWEVER, storing your lollipops in sealed Ball Jars will significantly draw your lollipop&#39;s shelf life out, in many cases by as long as a year.  \r\n\r\nCandy: Most of our candies are equally sensitive to the elements, and the same shelf life rules apply as do above re: lollipops.  The exceptions to the rule are our Floral Barks, which are made with heavy organic cream and have about a two week shelf life after delivery, and our Xylitol mints, which have about a 6-8 month shelf life.  \r\n\r\nOur Eco-Freindly Promise —\r\n\r\nAll pops are made in responsible ceramic ‘green pans.’  Green pans are lead, cadmium, Teflon, and PFOA free.  We do not use aluminum and work on unbleached, chlorine free FSC certified parchment papers.\r\n\r\nOur shipping materials consist of recycled biodegradable cardboard, recycled paper shreds, and unbleached, petroleum and chlorine free recyclable snack bags made from 100% renewable resources. Our waxed bags (when we use them) are soy free, unbleached, and made from natural Parrafin wax; they are landfill safe and will not degrade and contaminate groundwater.

Some ingredients (i.e. curry powder and siracha) are not organic, and very rarely we may use a artificial flavor along with another natural one, BUT we cite the ingredients on each listing so you will always know what you&#39;re getting.\r\n\r\nWholesale —\r\n\r\nWe do have wholesale prices for resellers and discount prices for people buying in bulk for weddings, parties, etc.  We work with a number of shops and vendors and would love yo work with you too!  Please convo us for more information.\r\n\r\nCustom Orders —\r\n\r\nYes!!!  If you can think it we&#39;d love to do it, try it, work with you!",

These are typically set up to printed on a standard letter sized sheet and each label should be cut to approximately 4&quot; x 3.25&quot;. \r\n\r\nTypically you can use a full shipping label and have it printed on any commercial printer. For instance Office Depot, etc all can print for $0.70 per copy and can even cut it for you!  Or you can send the file to a printer and they will print on cut on their professional machines.   \r\n\r\nIf you are printing labels instead of tags I do not suggest purchasing pre-cut (Avery for instance) labels and attempting to line up the file to their layout.  It is definitely easiest to print the file on a full sheet and cut to your dimensions!\r\n\r\nHope they are a hit!\r\nRachel",

Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door)\r\nPRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!",

Proofs must be approved within 14 days or will be shipped as-is.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that some designs have all lowercase font (disregarding proper noun capitalization) per their design -- although this is intended and recommended it can be changed if stated in a separate sentence as a &quot;request for proper noun capitalization&quot;",

If you are in a time crunch, please note this on your order at checkout and we&#39;ll do our best to get your fabulous labels to you on time.\r\n\r\nWishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a safe holiday season!\r\n\r\nHappy Everything!\r\n\r\nRachel",
