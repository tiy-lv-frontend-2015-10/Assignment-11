If you absolutely require a tracking number from the US Mail, please let us know in a convo prior to placing your order, and we will let you know if an extra fee applies.  \r\n\r\nWhen delivering to residences, it is UPS and the US Mail&#39;s policy to not require a signature.  Should you require someone to sign for the package(s) please let us know and we can let you know what the additional cost would be.\r\n\r\nThe addressee MUST BE KNOWN by the Post Office, UPS, FED-EX or other delivery service to reside at the address you are shipping to.  If the addressee is not known to reside there, you MUST address the label with a C\/O (care of) someone that is known to reside there.\r\n\r\nIf you have us ship to an address, and the Post Office deems it to be UNDERLIVERABLE or UNDELIVERABLE AS ADDRESSED or some similar terminology, and we have addressed the package as you have instructed, our obligation has been completed at that point.  Should the package be returned to us, we will contact you with a new shipping price to re-mail it to you.  Should the package not be returned to us, or returned damage, we will not be responsible for any refund or replacement of any amount.\r\n\r\nLOST PACKAGES SHIPPED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES:\r\nIf your package does not arrive by the estimated date provided by the post office, UPS or other delivery service, we will decide to either replace or refund your purchase 14 business days, excluding holidays, after the delivery service&#39;s estimated delivery date.  The only exception would be FIRST CLASS MAIL, which would be 21 business days, excluding holidays.  This will be an allowable timeframe for misrouted packages to arrive to you.\r\n\r\nWe have had instances where packages delivered to apartment buildings were delayed as the mailman decided not to leave the package in the hallway unattended.\r\n\r\nWhen we send you the shipping convo, it would be a good idea to arrange to have the package delivered to a neighbor (leave a note for the mailman) or ask the post office to hold any packages at the post office for you to pickup.\r\n\r\nUPS WILL LEAVE packages unattended, so you should definately arrange to be home or leave a note for the UPS driver to deliver to a neighbor.  The neighbor would need to be a next door apt as UPS will not deliver to another building free of charge.\r\n\r\nCANADIAN and INTERNATIONAL shipments: If you require a tracking number, UPS is the only option. Please contact us to see if the shipping charges shown in the listing is for UPS or Mail. Any duties and taxes will be the responsibility of the customer.  Shipments made to Canada or Internationally by a service other than UPS (ie: Postal Service) are not guarranteed as the tracking numbers are only good until the package reaches the US border, then the receiving country takes control.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSURANCE:  \r\nAll shipments ARE NOT insured.  Should you require insurance for lost packages, damage, etc, let us know prior to placing your order so we may give you a price.  Any packages delivered to you in a damaged condition MUST be reported to the delivery person BEFORE YOU SIGN for the package.  Any damaged packages that have not been reported to the delivery person before you sign, will not be refunded or exchanged by us.","policy_refunds":"Our items are all made to order, so once an order has been entered and work begun there is no way of refunding your purchase should you decide to cancel.

If there is a damaged product, you will need to send us photograph(s) clearly showing the damage.  We can instruct you as to what we need for photographs based on the product.  If a refund is issued we may require a photo showing the product is no longer usable.  This would require a photograph showing the engraving or other part of the product marred, scratched or otherwise rendered unusable.  We do not want any of our products in use if thy are not up to our standards for quality.  We will instruct you how marr and photograph the item.\r\n\r\nPlease also see the above section for refund info.","policy_additional":"How to contact Killorglin Creations.\r\n\r\n***** ONLY use the ETSY convo system and NOT regular email. ****\r\n\r\nThe Etsy system ties all convos to the order and reduces miscommunications.\r\nAny requests MUST be sent through the Etsy system ONLY.

My Inspiration is based on several themes RUSTIC\/UPCYCLING\/RECYCLING\/BRASS and SPLATTER PUNK HORROR.....\r\n\r\nWEDDING\/PARTY\/EVENTS\r\nIn my shop you will now find handcrafted Lipbalms, Scratch cards & favour boxes that are ideal for wedding\/party favours.......Order them in bulk to receive a discount....You can also choose to have them personalised at no extra cost too.\r\n\r\nBOOTIES & SLIPPERS-\r\nSince having my beautiful daughter, i acquired a love for cute baby clothes & wanted to create her things made by hand- so you will now find baby booties made from cotton fabrics & beautiful woven baby wrap scraps.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope you love my work as much as i enjoy designing and creating it :-)\r\n\r\nRUSTIC & BRASS\r\nBeen a Yorkshire (Huddersfield) girl myself, I try to use locally sourced recycled, antique, finds from as near to Yorkshire as I possibly can, but when I fall in love with something I just have to have it, so some items may have flown from the other side of the world to be made into a piece of Medusa&#39;s wearable artwork.\r\nYou will notice a lot of the items I have listed are made from raw & antique brass, this has been sourced from turkey. I love my brass supplier, there is so much choice to inspire my crazy & rustic designs and it&#39;s the best quality I have found after searching for so many years! \r\nI am proud to say that I am not scared of using something different that others may shy away from.\r\n\r\nSPLATTER PUNK HORROR\r\nThe other side of Medusa Bijoux is my love of Splatter Punk & Horror. You may find some disturbing pieces within this range, with realistic blood splattered beads & murder themed names.....it&#39;s not real blood....Honest :-) \r\n  \r\nI love a challenge so if there is something you have in mind but cannot find within my shop please message me to discuss custom pieces & alterations.\r\n\r\nI also offer an alteration & repairs service (FREE for Medusa Bijoux items, no matter how long you have had them) you only pay for postage.\r\n\r\nMost items can be made to measure, if you require this service please message me before you pay to ensure it&#39;s possible to do so.\r\nIf you realise after your purchase is received that size needs to be adjusted please contact me to organise a free alteration, you will only be required to pay postage for this service.\r\n\r\nBased In Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England","currency_code":"GBP","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"We will be closed for business from 7th Sept until 11th Sept 2015 to enjoy a well deserved break with our family, sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nAll messages will be answered on or shortly after the 11th Sept...if you placed an order before 7th Sept it is on it&#39;s way, unless otherwise discussed :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n","sale_message":"Thank You For Your Purchase, If you have any problems or your item arrives and you find it needs altering in anyway, Please message me & I will do my best to sort it out for you :-)\r\n\r\nMade to order Items- Please note that our processing time is clearly stated on all listings, it is usually around 1-2 weeks. \r\nShipping time is NOT included in the process time.\r\n\r\nIf you require your order by a certain date please message to see if this can actually be done.

She opened her first Etsy shop, SilverSquirrel, in 2006, while designing beaded jewelry. She experimented with other art mediums, read lots of books on business and marketing, and basically absorbed everything she could before falling in love with glass etching with a rotary tool. She officially started Bread and Badger later that year, and opened this Etsy shop the following summer, of 2007.\r\n\r\nOnce Bread and Badger really took off in 2008, Amanda&#39;s husband, Sean, quit his full-time job to run the business with her. They&#39;ve since turned to sandblasting, which has given them an opportunity to actually make a living creating art that they love. Sean enjoys playing video games, reading, cooking amazing meals, and maintaining his ever-growing collection of planted aquariums. Amanda&#39;s artistic inspirations include tattoo art, classic motifs from around the world, pop art and geek culture. In her spare time, Amanda enjoys audio books, comics, video games, cooking, knitting, and learning things on the internet. Honey badgers are her favorite animal, and continue to inspire her with their fearlessness.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n \u2605 Technique \u2605 \r\nOur etched designs are 100% permanent, and can absolutely be put in a dishwasher and microwave unless otherwise noted. Since the sandblasting and engraving processes remove the top layer of glass or ceramic glaze by cutting into it, the only way to remove the design would be to melt it down in a kiln. There are a lot of decals out there on glassware that look like etching, but they wear off with time. Our process will never do that! Sandblasting also has a smooth, even finish, unlike laser-etching (which shows a matrix pattern on its etched surface) and acid cream etching which can be splotchy and uneven.","policy_payment":" \u2605 Payments \u2605 \r\nWe accept payments through Etsy or Paypal, but you can use all major credit\/debit cards or use funds from you bank account. E-Checks (Paypal payments deducted directly from a bank account) take a number of days to clear (3-14 business days), so please plan accordingly if you need shipment immediately.","policy_shipping":"\u2605 PICK UP YOUR ORDER IN PERSON!

You&#39;ll receive a confirmation email with a tracking number when we&#39;re shipping your order.\r\n\r\nOrders include insurance and Delivery Confirmation when possible. Packages may be left on doorsteps or insecure locations, as the delivery person sees fit. Unfortunately, we have no control over this unless you request and pay for signature confirmation. Shipping items to a work address is often a good idea. We cannot refund shipping charges for UNCLAIMED packages or returns.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n \u2605 International Orders \u2605\r\n\r\nATTENTION INTERNATIONAL SHOPPERS (outside USA):\r\nIf ordering 4 or more cups, we will most likely be forced to upgrade your order to Priority Mail shipping because of weight restrictions. Because Etsy&#39;s system doesn&#39;t always calculate costs correctly, we may have to charge you for more postage. If you are overcharged, we&#39;re happy to send a refund. (Rocks, lowball, juice and shot glasses can ship in sets of 4 with 2-6 week shipping, but not with other items.)\r\n\r\nInternational orders (shipping outside the U.S.) travel First Class or Priority Mail, based on weight and size of the package (larger orders travel Priority, which is faster and more expensive). Delivery dates and tracking info are unavailable for most international orders, and usually take about 8 days to arrive, but can sometimes take 2-3 months.\r\n\r\nAll duties and customs fees are the responsibility of the buyer, and can be extremely high in certain cases. We cannot legally ship your package as a gift, so expect to deal with these fees yourself.  We cannot refund shipping charges for UNCLAIMED packages or returns.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n \u2605 Damages\/Claims \u2605 \r\nOur glassware is packaged very carefully to withstand transit, but sometimes accidents happen. If something arrives broken, please contact us immediately so we can replace it.\r\n\r\nTheft and breakage very rarely occur. Please contact us immediately if you feel your package has been lost or damaged.","policy_refunds":"Satisfaction is guaranteed! If you are not completely satisfied with any item that you have ordered, return your purchase within ten days to receive an exchange, credit or refund (except custom-made or personalized items). Please package glass items the same way we sent them to you, as they are very fragile! We are unable to refund shipping charges.","policy_additional":" \u2605 Disclaimer \u2605 \r\n\r\nWe do not manufacture glassware or ceramic items ourselves, so availability of colors and quantities is limited to what we can find.\r\n\r\nSome pieces may have minor imperfections on them.
